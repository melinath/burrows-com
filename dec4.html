<P>As to the kind of drawing that should be taught to men engaged in
ornamental work, there is only one best way of teaching drawing, and
that is teaching the scholar to draw the human figure: both because
the lines of a man's body are much more subtle than anything else,
and because you can more surely be found out and set right if you go
wrong. I do think that such teaching as this, given to all people who
care for it, would help the revival of the arts very much: the habit
of discriminating between right and wrong, the sense of pleasure in
drawing a good line, would really, I think, be education in the due
sense of the word for all such people as had the germs of invention
in them; yet as aforesaid, in this age of the world it would be mere
affectation to pretend to shut one's eyes to the art of past ages:
that also we must study. In other circumstances, social and
economical do not stand in our way, that is to say, if the world is
not too busy to allow us to have Decorative Arts at all, these two
are the direct means by which we shall get them; that is, general
cultivation of the powers of the mind, general cultivation of the
powers of the eye and hand.</P>

<P>Perhaps that seems to you very commonplace advice and a very
roundabout road; nevertheless 'tis a certain one, if by any road you
desire to come to the new art, which is my subject to-night: if you
do not, and if those germs of invention, which, as I said just now,
are no doubt still common enough among men, are left neglected and
undeveloped, the laws of Nature will assert themselves in this as in
other matters, and the faculty of design itself will gradually fade
from the race of man. Sirs, shall we approach nearer to perfection by
casting away so large a part of that intelligence that makes us
men?</P>

<P>And now before I make an end, I want to call your attention to
certain things, that, owing to our neglect of the arts for other
business, bar that good road to us and are such a hindrance, that,
till they are dealt with, it is hard even to make a beginning of our
endeavour. And if my talk should seem to grow too serious for our
subject, as indeed I think it cannot do, I beg you to remember what I
said earlier, of how the arts all hang together. Now there is one art
of which the old architect of Edward the Third's time was thinking -
he who founded New College, Oxford, I mean - when he took this for
his motto: `Manners maketh man:' he meant by manners the art of
morals, the art of living worthily, and like a man. I must needs
claim this art also as dealing with my subject.</P>

<P>Sirs, there is a great deal of sham work in the world, hurtful to
the buyer, more hurtful to the seller, if he only knew it, most
hurtful to the maker: how good a foundation it would be toward
getting good Decorative Art, that is ornamental workmanship, if we
craftsmen were to resolve to turn out nothing but excellent
workmanship in all things, instead of having, as we too often have
now, a very low average standard of work, which we often fail
below.</P>

<P>I do not blame either one class or another in this matter, I blame
all: to set aside our own class of handicraftsmen, of whose
shortcomings you and I know so much that we need talk no more about
it, I know that the public in general are set on having things cheap,
being so ignorant that they do not know when they get them nasty
also, so ignorant that they neither know nor care whether they give a
man his due: I know that the manufacturers (so-called) are so set on
carrying out competition to its utmost, competition of cheapness, not
of excellence, that they meet the bargain-hunters half way, and
cheerfully furnish them with nasty wares at the cheap rate they are
asked for, by means of what can be called by no prettier name than
fraud. England has of late been too much busied with the
counting-house and not enough with the workshop: with the result that
the counting-house at the present moment is rather barren of
orders.</P>

<P>I say all classes are to blame in this matter, but also I say that
the remedy lies with the handicraftsmen, who are not ignorant of
these things like the public, and who have no call to be greedy and
isolated like the manufacturers or middlemen; the duty and honour of
educating the public lies with them, and they have in them the seeds
of order and organization which make the duty the easier.</P>

<P>When will they see to this and help to make men of us by insisting
on this most weighty piece of manners; so that we may adorn life with
the pleasure of cheerfully buying goods at their due price; with the
pleasure of selling goods that we could be proud of both for fair
price and fair workmanship: with the pleasure of working soundly and
without haste at making goods that we could be proud of? - much the
greatest pleasure of the three is that last, such a pleasure as, I
think, the world has none like it.</P>

<P>You must not say that this piece of manners lies out of my
subject: it is essentially a part of it and most important: for I am
bidding you learn to be artists, if art is not to come to an end
amongst us: and what is an artist but a workman who is determined
that, whatever else happens, his work shall be excellent? or, to put
it in another way: the decoration of workmanship, what is it but the
expression of man's pleasure in successful labour? But what pleasure
can there be in bad work, in unsuccessful labour, why should we
decorate that? and how can we bear to be always unsuccessful in our
labour?</P>

<P>As greed of unfair gain, wanting to be paid for what we have not
earned, cumbers our path with this tangle of bad work, of sham work,
so the heaped-up money which this greed has brought us (for greed
will have its way, sirs, like all other strong passions), this money,
I say, gathered into heaps little and bit, with all the false
distinction which so unhappily it yet commands amongst us, has raised
up against the arts a barrier of the love of luxury and show, which
is of all obvious hindrances the worst to overpass: the highest and
most cultivated classes are not free from the vulgarity of it, the
lower are not free from its pretence. I beg you to remember both as a
remedy against this, and as explaining exactly what I mean, that
nothing can be a work of art which is not useful; that is to say,
which does not minister to the body when well under command of the
mind, or which does not amuse, soothe, or elevate the mind in a
healthy state. What tons upon tons of unutterable rubbish pretending
to be works of art in some degree would this maxim clear out of our
London houses, if it were understood and acted upon! To my mind it is
only here and there (out of the kitchen) that you can find in a
well-to-do house things that are of any use at all: as a rule all the
decoration (so called) that has got there is there for the sake of
show, not because anybody likes it. I repeat, this stupidity goes
through all classes of society: the silk curtains in my Lord's
drawing-room are no more a matter of art to him than the powder in
his footman's hair; the kitchen in a country farmhouse is most
commonly a pleasant and homelike place, the parlour dreary and
useless.</P>

<P>Simplicity of live, begetting simplicity of taste, that is, a love
for sweet and lofty things, is of all matters most necessary for the
birth of the new and better art we crave for; simplicity everywhere,
in the palace as well as in the cottage.</P>

<P>Still more is this necessary, cleanliness and decency everywhere,
in the cottage as well as in the palace: the lack of that is a
serious piece of manners for us to correct: that lack and all the
inequalities of life, and the heaped-up thoughtlessness and disorder
of so many centuries that cause it: and as yet it is only a very few
men who have begun to think about a remedy for it in its widest
range: even in its narrower aspect, in the defacement of our big
towns by all that commerce brings with it, who heeds it? who tries to
control their squalor and hideousness? there is nothing but
thoughtlessness and recklessness in the matter: the helplessness of
people who don't live long enough to do a thing themselves, and have
not manliness and foresight enough to begin to work, and pass it on
to those that shall come after them.</P>

<P>Is money to be gathered? cut down the pleasant trees among the
houses, pull down ancient and venerable buildings for the money that
a few square yard of London dirt will fetch, blacken rivers, hide the
sun and poison the air with smoke and worse, and it's nobody's
business to see to it or mend it: that is all that modern commerce,
the counting-house forgetful of the workshop, will do for us
herein.</P>
