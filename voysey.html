         <P><A NAME=stag></A>"<B>The Stag</B>" depicts an enchanted
         landscape, an artists' vision of an English Royal Park,
         abstracted and stylized in the design tradition of the Arts
         &amp; Crafts Movement. This pattern was originally published
         as a new wallpaper design by C.F.A. Voysey in THE STUDIO in
         1896. Later, the pattern was reworked for textile and carpet
         weaving. We have returned to the original, but less well
         known, version for our hand silk-screen printed
         wallpaper.</P>
         
         <P>Voysey's pattern designs express a childlike innocence,
         with crisp lines, spare detail, and hallmark "Voysey-birds"
         in many of the patterns for wallpaper and fabric. His
         architecture was also spare in line and detail, invoking the
         essence of the English cottage in a modern manner, and
         Voysey was also one of the most noteworthy designers of Arts
         &amp; Crafts Movement furniture.</P>

         <P><B>The Stag</B>, by C.F.A. Voysey, Architect and
         Designer</P>
         
         <P>An exclusive design from Rose's Mill in Scotland, made as
         a fine 10-point lace. Burrows &amp; Co. also offers The Stag
         as a hand-printed wallpaper, and as a border.</P>
         
         <P>C.F.A. Voysey was a prominent Arts &amp; Crafts Movement
         architect and designer from England. His lace panel of The
         Stag was originally produced in Scotland in the early
         1900s.</P>
         
         <P>Many English Arts &amp; Crafts textiles are of a grand
         scale, even though they are often used in houses of modest
         scale. This large panel is beautiful on windows as narrow as
         35 - 40" wide by using one panel per window. John Burrows
         has The Stag as drapes in his sitting room windows - pulled
         back to one side and gathered a foot above the window sill
         with a curtain tie-back - they are draped low to hang very
         full so that the design can be seen to best advantage.
         Because of the overall figuring in the pattern, they are an
         excellent design for the windows of houses in the city and
         suburbs that do not have a worthwhile view (shades under the
         lace are still recommended when privacy is required at
         night).</P>
         
         <P>As well as a stunning curtain panel, this design can be
         used as bed hangings for four-poster beds. We also suggest
         The Stag as a bed covering over a dark coverlet or sheet
         (95" fits a full size mattress, and 118" long fits a
         queen-size mattress).</P>

         <P><A NAME=bird></A><B>"The Bird &amp; Poppy"</B> "The Bird
         &amp; Poppy" features stylized birds, and the foliage and
         flowers of the poppy, in characteristic manner of Voysey
         patterns. Many of Voysey's pattern designs were drawn
         without reference to manufacturer; in other words, they were
         drawn on speculation and offered to both wallpaper and
         fabric printers. (This is quite different from the pattern
         designs of William Morris, who drew most designs
         specifically for the final medium.) Two original pieces of
         "The Bird &amp; Poppy" exist in museum collections in
         England and California, and both were printed on silk as
         novelty bedspreads. However, as the design repeat is the
         exact scale of English wallpaper prints, it is most likely
         that Voysey would have considered the pattern well suited
         for a wallpaper as well.</P>
