<P>Now as these arts call people's attention and interest to the
matters of every-day life in the present, so also, and that I think
is no little matter, they call our attention at every step to that
history, of which, I said before, they are so great a part; for no
nation, no state of society, however rude, has been wholly without
them: nay, there are peoples not a few, of whom we know scarce
anything, save that they thought such and such forms beautiful. So
strong is the bond between history and decoration, that in the
practice of the latter we cannot, if we would, wholly shake off the
influence of past times over what we do at present. I do not think it
is too much to say that no man, however original he may be, can sit
down to-day and draw the ornament of a cloth, or the form of an
ordinary vessel or piece of furniture, that will be other than a
development or a degradation of forms used hundreds of years ago; and
these, too, very often, forms that once had a serious meaning, though
they are now become little more than a habit of the hand; forms that
were once perhaps the mysterious symbols of worships and beliefs now
little remembered or wholly forgotten. Those who have diligently
followed the delightful study of these arts are able as if through
windows to look upon the life of the past: - the very first
beginnings of thought among nations whom we cannot even name; the
terrible empires of the ancient East; the free vigor and glory of
Greece; the heavy weight, the firm grasp of Rome; the fall of her
temporal Empire which spread so wide about the world all that good
and evil that men can never forget, and never cease to feel; the
clashing of East and West, South and North, about her rich and
fruitful daughter Byzantium; the rise, the dissension, and the waning
of Islam; the wanderings of Scandinavia, the Crusades, the foundation
of the States of modern Europe, the struggles of free thought with
ancient dying system - with all these events and their meaning is the
history of popular art interwoven; with all this, I say, the careful
student of decoration as an historical industry must be familiar.
When I think of this, and the usefulness of all this knowledge, at a
time when history has become so earnest a study amongst us as to have
given us, as it were, a new sense; at a time when we so long to know
the reality of all that has happened, and are to be put off no longer
with the dull records of the battles and intrigues of kings and
scoundrels, - I say when I think of all this, I hardly know how to
say that this connection of the Decorative Arts with the history of
the past is of less importance than their dealings with the life of
the present; for should not these memories also be a part of our
daily life?</P>

<P>And now let me recapitulate a little before I go further, before
we begin to look into the condition of the arts at the present day.
These arts, I have said, are part of a great system invented for the
expression of a man's delight in beauty: all peoples and times have
used them; they have been the joy of free nations, and the solace of
oppressed nations; religion has used and elevated them, has abused
and degraded them; they are connected with all history, and are clear
teachers of it; and, best of all, they are the sweeteners of human
labour, both to the handicraftsman, whose life is spent in working in
them, and to people in general who are influenced by the sight of
them at every turn of the day's work: they make our toil happy, our
rest fruitful.</P>

<P>And now if all I have said seems to you but more open-mouthed
praise of these arts, I must say that it is not for nothing that what
I have hitherto put before you has taken that form.</P>

<P>It is because I must now ask you this question: All these good
things - will you have them? will you cast them from you?</P>

<P>Are you surprised at my question - you, most of whom, like myself,
are engaged in the actual practice of the arts that are, or ought to
be, popular?</P>

<P>In explanation, I must somewhat repeat what I have already said.
time was when the mystery and wonder of handicrafts were well
acknowledged by the world, when imagination and fancy mingled with
all things made by man; and in those days all handicraftsmen were
artists, as we should now call them. But the thought of man became
more intricate, more difficult to express; art grew a heavier thing
to deal with, and its labour was more divided among great men, lesser
men, and little men; till that art, which was once scarce more than a
rest of body and soul, as the hand cast the shuttle or swung the
hammer, became to some men so serious a labour, that their lives have
been one long tragedy of hope and fear, their lives have been one
long tragedy of hope and fear, joy and trouble. This was the growth
of art: like all growth, it was good and fruitful growth, it grew
into decay; like all decay of what was once fruitful, it will grow
into something new.</P>

<P>Into decay; for as the arts sundered into the greater and the
lesser, contempt on one side, carelessness on the other arose, both
begotten of ignorance of that philosophy of the Decorative Arts, a
very slight outline of which I have tried just now to put before you.
The artist came out from the handicraftsmen, and left them without
hope of elevation, while he himself was left without the help of
intelligent, industrious sympathy. Both have suffered; the artist no
less than the workman. it is with art as it fares with a company of
soldiers before a redoubt, when the captain runs forward full of hope
and energy, but looks not behind him to see if his men are following,
and they hang back, not knowing why they are brought there to die.
The captain's life is spent for nothing, and his men are sullen
prisoners in the redoubt of Unhappiness and Brutality.</P>

<P>I must in plain words say of the Decorative Arts, of all the arts,
that it is not merely that we are inferior in them to all who have
gone before us, but also that they are in a state of anarchy and
disorganization, that makes a sweeping change necessary and
certain.</P>

<P>So that again I ask my question, All that good fruit which the
arts should bear, will you have it? will you cast it from you? Shall
that sweeping change that must come be the change of loss or of gain?
We who believe in the continuous life of the world, surely we are
bound to hope that the change will bring us gain and not loss, and to
strive to bring that gain about.</P>

<P>How the world may answer my question, who can say? A man in his
sort life can see but a little way ahead, and even in mine wonderful
and unexpected things have come to pass. I must needs say that
therein lies my hope rather than in all I see going on round about
us. Without disputing that if the imaginative arts perish, some new
thing, at present unguessed of, may be put forward to supply their
loss in men's lives, I cannot feel happy in that prospect, nor can I
believe that mankind will endure such a loss for ever: but in the
meantime the present state of the arts and their dealings with modern
life and progress seem to me to a point in appearance to this
immediate future; that the world, which has for a long time busied
itself about other matters than the arts, and has carelessly let them
sink lower and lower, till many not uncultivated men, ignorant of
what they once were, and hopeless of what they might yet be, look
upon them with mere contempt; that the world, I say, thus busied and
hurried, will one day wipe the slate, and be clean rid in her
impatience of the whole mater with all its tangle, and then - what
then? Even now amid the squalor of London it is hard to imagine what
it will be. Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, with the crowd of
lesser arts that belong to them, these, together with Music and
Poetry, will be dead and forgotten, will no longer excite or amuse
people in the least: for, once more, we must not deceive ourselves;
the death of one art means the death of all; the only difference in
their fate will be that the luckiest will be eaten the last - the
luckiest, or the unluckiest: in all that has to do with beauty the
invention and ingenuity of man will have come to a dead stop; and all
the while Nature will go on with her eternal recurrence of lovely
changes: spring, summer, autumn, and winter; sunshine, rain, and
snow, storm and fair weather; dawn, noon, and sunset, day and night -
ever bearing witness against man that he has deliberately chosen
ugliness instead of beauty, and to live where he is strongest amidst
squalor or blank emptiness.</P>
