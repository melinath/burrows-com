<P>The following selection is from one of <A HREF="poolbio.html">Maria
Louise Pool</A> most popular novels, <B>Roweny in Boston</B>,
published in 1892 re-issued in 1900.</P>

<P><I>Note: the Browning Society still meets monthly on Beacon Hill
in Boston, and has not greatly changed.</I><BR>

<HR>

</P>

<P>Then it occurred to her that this evening she was going to the
Browning Club. There was a tumultuous quickening of her pulses at the
thought. She was conscious of a shy longing to see this new kind of
people. And the prospect of meeting Miss Phillipps was always a
distinct pleasure to her.</P>

<P>Does not one who has spent much time in Boston remember the large
women with gray curls looped up each side of their large faces? They
are ruddy, with a comfortable consciousness of living in Boston
diffused through their redundant personality. They always look, as
you see them walking on Charles or Beacon Street, as if they had just
descended from an intensely Bostonian coupe. If you peer into that
coupe you will see the last "Atlantic" in the pocket; perhaps, also,
a pamphlet on Nationalism, or a sketch of Confucius as he was, not
Confucius as we have thought he was. Somebody in Boston has found out
the exact facts concerning him, and to Boston is given the
discovery.</P>

<P>The horses in the shafts will not have any check-rein nor any
curb-bit, for this kind of woman does not confine herself to
theories. She has a soft spot in her heart for animals, for
everything that is abused or that does not have its rights.</P>

<P>Besides "The Atlantic" and the pamphlet, there is often also in
this carriage a dog. He is sitting calmly superior to mere "foot
folks." He is a well-groomed King Charley or Yorkshire. Never a fox
terrier for this kind of woman. The dog meets your eye with a gentle
pity in his expression, a pity for you because you are not a
Yorkshire sitting in a coupe belonging to a person like his mistress.
He knows there is a sketch of Confucius in the vehicle with him, and
he respects himself accordingly. He wags his little stub of a tail if
you approach. He is perfectly affable. He knows his position too well
not to be so. He is like his dear friend and mistress; it is a good
thing that, incidentally, he has wealth, but he is sincere in his
conviction that wealth is not to be compared with culture and blood.
He probably has clear ideas as to what Buddha preached; anyway, his
eyes are bright enough to have such ideas. He is not going to fall
into Nirvana when he dies; he confidently expects that in the future
state cats will be provided for him to worry.</P>

<P>There were three of these gray-haired ladies in the rooms of the
house on Charles Street where Miss Phillipps lived. They put up
tortoise-shell-handled eye-glasses and looked at Rowena when she
entered, not impertinently, but with the questioning air they gave to
everything new.</P>

<P>There were young ladies, also, in the rooms, a few men. There was
a murmur of talk and low laughter.</P>

<P>The rooms themselves were, in reality, almost simple, but they
seemed magnificent to Rowena. There were low fireplaces, in which
smouldered heavy oak logs. There was no gaslight, but queer old lamps
shed a mellow light. To this country girl everything appeared in
keeping with Miss Phillipps.</P>

<P>It was enough for Miss Phillipps that she was Miss Phillipps;
enough for her house that it was hers.</P>

<P>This hostess when she chose could do some kind things with a grace
that made them more than kind.</P>

<P>An almost tender light came into the green-tinted eyes as their
owner saw that black-clad slender, hesitating, and altogether
charming figure in the door-way.</P>

<P>Ignorant and unsophisticated as Rowena was, she could not be
awkward. There is a hesitancy like that of the flower stalk which
hardly knows from which direction the breeze is coming.</P>

<P>A man standing at the end of the first room, with his hands behind
him, rather carelessly listening to one of the gray-haired ladies,
saw Rowena the instant she appeared. He saw, also, a swift suffusion
of gladness go over the girl's face as she met Miss Phillipp's
glance. That lady walked quickly to her side and took both her hands
in an impressive welcome. This welcome was meant to show her own
feelings towards this stranger, and to set an example.</P>

<P>"Who is this that Vanessa has taken up now?" asked Mrs. Sears,
with her glass up.</P>

<P>"Weally, I don't know," was the answer from the gentleman whom
Rowena had seen riding with Miss Phillipps.</P>

<P>Though he said "weally," he did not look like a man who would say
it. Though he had a glass in his eye, he did not look like a man who
would have a glass in his eye. There were several incongruities about
this individual.</P>

<P>"Vanessa is sometimes very trying," went on Mrs. Sears, as their
hostess led Rowena to an old lady who was sitting near the fireplace
holding a screen between her face and the heat. "She takes up a
person or a theory with ardor, and then - "</P>

<P>"She puts them down with ardor," said the gentleman. "It doesn't
hurt the theowy, a theowy can stand it; but a person doesn't like it,
naturally."</P>

<P>"That girl is something quite out of the ordinary," said Mrs.
Sears. She had removed her glass. Now she lifted it again. "She is -
why -" searching for fitting terms of praise - "she might almost be
one of Us."</P>

<P>The man smiled.</P>

<P>"Where did you say she came from?"</P>

<P>"From Middle Village - or thereabouts."</P>

<P>"But I thought you didn't know anything about her."</P>

<P>"I don't. But I know Vanessa has secured a girl from Middle
Village with whom she is now infatuated."</P>

<P>An inarticulate murmur was all the response to this remark.</P>

<P>Miss Phillipps was now bringing Rowena to Mrs. Sears.</P>

<P>Keats Bradford thought he had never admired his cousin Vanessa as
strongly as he admired her now. You would have said from her manner
it was a princess whom she was conducting, choosing to do this rather
than wait for the people to be conducted to the princess.</P>

<P>It must have been a very hard-hearted elderly lady indeed who
could resist the desire to greet Rowena warmly. There was about her
the penetrating grace of unsullied youth, and nothing is more
attractive to age. Moreover, her own indescribable and individual
personality, which, perhaps, Miss Phillipps called her "atmosphere,"
which is born with one, and which makes one beloved or shunned, this
was markedly winning.</P>

<P>Mrs. Sears took the girl's hand in her thick, cushiony palm.</P>

<P>"So you have come to study Browning, Miss Tuttle? It is an
occupation which never fails."</P>

<P>The words did not mean very much, but they were said with the
accompaniment of the kindest smile. Mrs. Sears made room for Rowena
on the little couch where she sat.</P>

<P>The young man near her instantly came forward and asked to be
presented. The girl remembered him very well, but she tried not to
let her face show that she did so. Se was beginning to heed the
advice Miss Phillipps had given her concerning a reticence of
countenance.</P>

<P>The gentleman did not address her, save a few words after his
greeting. he continued to converse with Miss. Sears. But he had the
ability to let the girl know that she was in his thoughts; that,
though he talked to Mrs. Sears, it was that Miss Tuttle might hear
him.</P>

<P>Presently he looked at his watch. He said it was almost time for
him to read that selection. He walked away a few steps, then he
returned and said to Rowena:</P>

<P>"I have the honor to open the meeting. I shall not wead the
extract I selected yesterday. I want you to hear something else the
first time you come. I shall ask you what you think of it, so please
pay attention."</P>

<P>AT A BROWNING CLUB.</P>

<P>"Rivals, who... Tuned, from Bocafoli's stark-naked psalms, To
Plara's sonnets spoilt by toying with, As knops that stud some almug
to the pith Pricked for gum, wry thence, and crinkled worse Than
pursed eyelids of a river-horse Sunning himself o' the slime when
whirrs the breeze - Gad-fly, that is."</P>

<P>"Oh, no; I never go anywhere without my little geological hammer,
not even down Washington Street. My hammer and one of Ibsen's plays.
One never knows, don't you know, when one may find a specimen; and it
is so interesting to get a new one - and then, if I have to wait a
few moments in a shop, don't you know, if I have Ibsen with me, I
don't lose any time, you see."</P>

<P>"It must be quite dreadful to lose any time," said Mrs. Sears,
with an indulgent smile that had a suspicion of irony in it. "Did you
bring your hammer with you to-day, Miss Sargeant? You might pound
away at 'Childe Roland.' I think it would bear all your
strength."</P>

<P>"Is it to be 'Childe Roland' again to-day?"</P>

<P>"Yes."</P>

<P>The owner of the geological hammer tossed her head. She had that
type of weasel-face which Rowena had noticed in one of the
sales-ladies that evening at Mrs. Jarvis's. She did not look any more
refined. She was painfully alert. She tossed her head again. She said
for her part she was tired of that poem, if it were a poem. Why
didn't they drop Browning and take up Ibsen? She was told that this
was not an Ibsen club. She flung her bits of hands out and her
bangles tinkled. She gave sharp glances at Rowena, who still kept her
place by Mrs. Sears.</P>

<P>"I went out to Diamond Hill the other day," she began. "Rhode
Island, you know. Really a curious place; might be a thousand miles
away. Natives don't know anything; stand about in overalls - aren't
they overalls, Miss Tuttle?"</P>

<P>"They are overalls," replied Rowena, her clear voice contrasting
with the chipping noise this Miss Sargeant made in talking, "also
jumpers," added Rowena, with a slight laugh.</P>

<P>Miss Sargeant stared an instant. Then repeated: "Also jumpers.
Thanks. They stand around in these things, and look at you till you
feel their eyes boring like gimlets. I could feel them in the back of
my head. They fry their beefsteak there, too - in lard. And they
expect you to eat pickles with it - large cucumbers steeped in
vinegar."</P>

<P>"Did you get any specimens, Miss Sargeant?"</P>

<P>"Magnificent rough amethysts. I should think there must be a strat
of these amethysts somewhere there, a strata upthrown by some
subterranean action. Shouldn't you say so, Mrs. Sears?"</P>

<P>The elder lady had shrunk perceptibly at the word "strata," which
was spoken as if spelled "strarter."</P>

<P>"Don't you think, Miss Sargeant," she said, with some emphasis,
"that you might better use your geological hammer a trifle less, and
look into the subject of sungular and plural formations a trifle
more? Pardon an old woman's advice."</P>

<P>The girl stood an instant in vindictive silence. She was very fond
of that word "strarter."</P>

<P>She walked away.</P>

<P>Mrs. Sears glanced at Rowena.</P>

<P>"Do you think I was harsh, my dear?" she asked. "But then, I know
Della Sargeant so very well. If I can be the means of teaching her to
say stratum when that is what she means, I shall have done an
excellent thing. I may confide to you that her friends are very weary
of what she does not know about geology. Ah, Mr. Bradford is going to
read. Some one usually opens the session by reading a selection. I'm
glad it's not Mr. Herndon, for he never reads anything but
'Sardello." he says we don't meet to discuss what we know, but what
we don't know. To tell you the truth, Miss Tuttle, I have reached
that age when I like to talk about things I understand."</P>

<P>There was such a whimsical look on the speaker's face that Rowena
could not tell if she were speaking as she felt. Before she could
make any attempt at a reply some one rapped on a table which held
many different copies of the poet there were to study.</P>

<P>A stout man with a very large bald head and English whiskers said
in a heavy voice that Mr. Bradford had kindly consented to read for
them.</P>

<P>"That is Mr. Herndon," said Mrs. Sears. "He lives to struggle with
things he doesn't comprehend. The moment he sees a subject clearly,
that moment it ceases to interest him. Odd, isn't it?"</P>

<P>Instead of standing there by the table, which was very far away
from the couch which held Mrs. Sears and Rowena, Mr. Bradford
sauntered down the room until he came to a window near that couch. He
stood in a nonchalant attitude, with his back to the light. As a
reader in select companies he was rather of a lion, but this girl
from the country could not know that, and she sould not have
respected him any more had she known it.</P>

<P>The young man began: "O lyric Love, hald angel and half bird, And
all a wonder and a wild desire, -"</P>

<P>His voice was not spcially musical, but it interpreted the words
with a force as if fire ran along with his utterance. Rowena felt her
heart burning; every syllable clove its way to her soul. Had there
been a human being who could write such words as those? And he had
loved. And he had lost. But he could not despair.</P>

<P>She did not think of the reader at all. She did not know that
after those two first lines his eyes had left the book and were,
though not openly, watching her.</P>

<P>Miss Phillipps thought she had never heard her cousin read so
well. There was not the least art about it. He was simply letting
himself be borne on by the lines. Even she forgot herself in
listening. And she forgot Rowena, until just as Bradford came to the
last. Then, as she saw the girl, a cloud came over her face. It was
cruel to play on a sensitive and unsophisticated nature in this way.
And yet, Miss Phillipps knew that she had never loved Rowena as
warmly as at this moment. The young face gleamed transparent - the
eyes seemed reaching out to heaven itself.</P>

<P>Silently Miss Phillipps glided round behind her guests. Again she
was conscious of that desire to protect Rowena.</P>

<P>There was an instant murmur as the reader's voice ceased. Rowena
heard some one whisper, "Dear!" close behind her. She knew the tone,
and interpreted it.</P>

<P>She so quickly recovered her ordinary look that her friend's
estimate of her rose greatly.</P>

<P>Miss Phillipps did not address her again; she made some remark
about Browning as a poet of the emotions.</P>

<P>Mr. Herdon rose to read a portion of "Childe Roland."</P>

<P>Miss Sargeant said, when the portion had been read, that she
judged that the passage was so "electrically stimulating" that it was
not needful to know clearly what it meant.</P>

<P>Another young lady, in an almost man-like severity of costume,
said that what had most struck her in this author was his "formative
energy." He created, he energized: he said "Let this be," and
straightway it was. He was, more than any one who had come before
him, a kind of god.</P>

<P>Miss Sargeant now said earnestly that he was, above all else,
Bostonian. There were some natures so endowed that, though they had
never seen Boston, they were yet Bostonian. She considered Browning
so endowed.</P>

<P>Rowena heard in amazement. She say Miss Phillipps's lips fold
tightly together. She saw the smile on Keats Bradford's face. Mrs.
Sears turned to her with an impatient movement.</P>

<P>"I wonder whi it so often happens," she said, "that people with
the least mind are so ready to let us know their limitations."</P>

<P>Mr. Herndon said ponderously that he believed the question now
before the club was the question as to what the dark tower was. It
was asserted positively that "Childe Roland to the dark tower came,"
but what was the tower? Symbolical, of course. But symbolical of
what?"</P>

<P>" 'The round squat tower, blind as a fool's heart,' " recited Miss
Sargeant.</P>

<P>" 'Built of brownstone' - you see they used brownstone - 'without
a counterpart in the whole world.' "</P>

<P>This girl sat by a table holding a volume of poems in her hand.
She was perfectly sure of herself. She never meant to give up this
club. She knew they could not get along without her, and she loved to
throw light. She knew that her own ideas were clear.</P>

<P>Rowena rose and walked to the table, taking up one of the copies
of the poem that lay there. By this time she was so interested that
she had forgotten her surroundings.</P>

<P>She resumed her seat and read the poem for the first time,
experiencing a strange, baffled feeling, and that kind of admiration
awakened by power, even when it is obscure power. She read the poem
again, her face lightening. She looked up with flashing eyes. She
leaned forward. She fastened her glance on Mr. Herndon.</P>

<P>"It is glorious endeavor - sticking to your ideal - it is keeping
on with the fight - dauntless - courageous - it is - oh, how hard it
is to find words!"</P>

<P>A deep red covered her face. She suddenly sank back, slmost
against Mrs. Sears. But she kept her fiery glance on Mr. Herndon.
Before that gentleman could speak Miss Sargeant, in her voice like
the rattling of dry sticks, made this remark:</P>

<P>"That is very well. But what is the tower? We are losing sight of
the main subject. A brownstone tower - we know that much."</P>

<P>Mr. Bradford advanced from the window where he had remained since
he read from "The Ring and the Book."</P>

<P>"Miss Tuttle is wight," he said.</P>

<P>He looked over at the girl.</P>

<P>"Of course we are glad to know about the brownstone," bowing to
Miss Sargeant. "We have Mr. Browning's explicit word for that. I
cannot help wishing we could know if there was a bay window, or
anything of that sort; but we can only judge by internal evidence. I
think from the text it was a plain tower, without any such window.
What is your opinion, Miss Sargeant?"</P>

<P>Miss Phillipps had been standing with one hand leaning on a table.
She walked forward. Her face did not often fluch, but it was flushed
now.</P>

<P>"How silly we all are," she exclaimed, with that air she had of
being permitted to say anything. She went on rapidly, and with the
manner of one who gives an ultimate decision.</P>

<P>"It is just a gloomy phantasy - the sporting of a stong mind. We
take it seriously, we try to find what is not there."</P>

<P>She spoke nearly ten minutes, carried on by a kind of strenuous
earnestness that often took possession of her when she spoke at any
gathering of people. She showed a power which revealed to Rowena why
women concerned in any public meetings usually tried to have "that
Miss Phillipps" one of the speakers.</P>

<P>After she had ceased, Rowena cared very little for what followed.
She hardly listened to it. She sat quietly by Mrs. Sears, and heard
vaguely all the talk.</P>

<P>Mr. Bradford came and stood behind the couch where she sat.
Sometimes he bent over and said a word or two in an undertone to Mrs.
Sears. It was always said so that Rowena might hear it. he always
glanced at her. He found it extremely pleasant to stand there, and he
liked very much to do things which he found to be pleasant. This girl
had gratified a some-what exacting taste the first time he had seen
her on Tremont Street, with her portfolio under her arm. he had been
rather surprised at himself that he had remembered her face and
figure so well. Young women were usually very flat and unprofitable.
They made eyes, the put inflections in the voice, they sidled; they
pranced, or they were demure, not because they really were so, but
because they chose to appear so. And they were, some of them,
painfully intellectual; they kept one's mind strained up to the verge
of insanity; they never let one down.</P>

<P>This young man, lounging behind the counch where Rowena sat, was
conscious of a delightful feeling of refreshment. he did not speak to
her, because it was enough to be there, knowing that he might address
her if he chose. Since it was a Browning day, it was appropriate that
he should think of that much - quoted line from Evelyn Hope about
"spirit, fire and dew." He even went further than that. his mind
suddenly seized upon, "There's a woman like a dew-drop, She's so
purer than the purest." The whole song murmured itself over, and the
sense of it tingled in his veins and diffused itself deliciously
thorugh him. He had not thought he was inpressionable; certainly he
had not been so in these later years. But then, with an inward smile,
he told himself a man did not often meet a woman like this one. The
city life spoiled women; so did country life spoil them, in its
way.</P>

<P>When at last the club broke up and the members were departing,
Miss Phillipps detained Rowena.</P>

<P>"Will any one be frightened if you don't go back to that
Hudson-Street place to-night?" she asked.</P>

<P>"I don't suppose they will even know whether I'm there or not,"
was the reply.</P>

<P>"Then, of course, you'll stay. Keats, there is no need for you to
linger."</P>

<P>"You are awfully careless about hurting a fellow's self-esteem,
Vanessa," said the man. "I don't want to go yet. I want to sit by
this fire a minute. I'm so weary of Miss Sargeant and that other
little weasel of a girl."</P>

<P>He flung himself down and looked into the fireplace, where the log
was now a big coal.</P>

<P>The two girls were standing. "She was just like a weasel,"
responded Rowena, eagerly; "and there's one at R.H. Black's - a
saleslady; only one is a member of a Browning Club, and I guess the
other isn't," she laughed. She was in great spirits, better than at
any time since she had come to Boston. "Miss Phillipps" - she turned
with an impulsively fond movement towards that lady - "you said you
had been weeding out your club;why didn't you week out Miss
Sargeant?"</P>

<P>"Yes, why didn't you?" from Bradford.</P>

<P>But Miss Phillipps did not choose to reply. She sat down and drew
Rowena to her side. She was silent. She looked thoughtful, even
slightly troubled. But she was very tender towards the girl near her.
She did not notice her cousin. Still, he was content not to be
noticed by her.</P>

<P>"I intended to take Miss Tuttle down to what you call that
Hudson-Street place," he said, after a silence. "I thought she might
give me privately some of her views of us to-night. But, since I am
not to be useful that way, I can be simply ornamental - and
comfortable here."</P>

<P>He stretched his feet toward the fire and thrust his hands into
his pockets.</P>

<P>Rowena looked at him with a laugh in her eyes. The glance was
returned. Then she turned her own gaze toward the fire. She felt the
pressure of Miss Phillipps's arm about her shoulders, and the touch
gave her happiness. She was beginning to lose that fear she had had
of fickleness in her friend's regard for her. Just now she had no
fear of anything. She had never been so much at home with any one.
Looking back now she told herself that, of course, she had been at
home with Georgie Warner. But Georgie, though she loved her, "had not
known things." And then, one slightest touch of Miss Phillipps's hand
was more of a caress than a vigorous hug from Georgie. Rowena had not
known there were such people in the world as this new friend of hers.
She did not know now but that the world was full of them, only they
did not live out near Middle Village, or the Corners, or on Hudson
Street.</P>

<P>The silence continued so long that Bradford rose. There was still
humming over in his mind "There's a woman like a dew-drop." He had
been dangerously near repeating those words once or twice as he sat
there.</P>

<P>"Keats, I do wish you would go," said his cousin.</P>

<P>"Thank you," he responded, "I don't think I can stay any longer
this evening, though you urge me so kindly. Good-night, Vanessa.
Good-night, Miss Tuttle."</P>

<P>He held out his hand, a slender hand like that of his cousin.</P>

<P>He strolled to the door. He came back.</P>

<P>"Are you weally going to pweside at the Psychical Wesearch
to-morrow, Vanessa?"</P>

<P>He looked down at the two, but saw only the younger face with its
pure outline and shining eyes.</P>

<P>"Yes, I am."</P>

<P>"Oh, well," shrugging his shoulders, "they told me I must Pweside
if you concluded not to do it yourself. I wanted to get myself up a
bit, don't you know."</P>

<P>He stood an instant. His cousin did not glance at him, or she
would have been startled by something in his face.</P>

<P>"Your sweetness is very long drawn out to-night, Keats," she
said.</P>

<P>"I know it. I'm weally going now. Good-night," to Rowena, who bent
her head in silence.</P>

<P>This time the young man lifted the curtain at the entrance, and
presently the outer door shut heavily.</P>

<P>When he reached the pavement he straightened himself and stood
still a moment, looking vaguely about him. Then he smiled. then he
gave a long, srill whistle, and started to walk briskly down the
street.</P>

<P>In the room he had just left the silence continued for some
time.</P>

<P>Rowena, within her companion's arm, looked happily into the
fire.</P>

<P>"Was that a country friend with whom I saw you at the
theatre?"</P>

<P>The question came like a kind of blow to the girl. She moved
uneasily.</P>

<P>"Yes," she answered.</P>

<P>"Are you going to marry him?" Rowena now sat upright.</P>

<P>"No; no, indeed!" she almost cried out.</P>

<P>"He means to marry you. He has a good face; he has also a strong
will."</P>

<P>Rowena's heart contracted. She hurriedly rose and stood before her
questioner.</P>

<P>"Why do you talk to me like that?" she exclaimed.</P>

<P>Instead of replying, Miss Phillipps said:</P>

<P>"You should not go alone with him to the theatre."</P>

<P>Rowena blushed. "Not go alone with Philip Barrett?" she said. "Not
go alone with Philip?"</P>

<P>The eyes of the elder woman were searching the face before
her.</P>

<P>"Perhaps, without really knowing it, you love him," she said.</P>

<P>Rowena turned indignantly away from that gaze.</P>

<P>The words opened bewildering possibilities to her. Did she not
know herself? She recalled Philip's face as he had said "he didn't
want to plague her," and "he could wait." The recollection almost
melted her. She could at this moment recall nothing of all that in
his appearance which had irritated her. She was only conscious of his
noble unselfishness and his devotion.</P>

<P>"I don't think I love him," she said.</P>

<P>Her face took on a wistful expression. She looked down at her
companion.</P>

<P>"Don't you know when you love a man?" she asked.</P>

<P>Miss Phillipps laughed slightly. She reached forth and drew the
girl down by her again.</P>

<P>"According to the old-fashioned stories," she replied, "we knew
when we loved just as we knew when lightning flashed before our eyes.
But we have changed all that. Now we are not sure of anything."</P>

<P>Rowena pressed closely. She timidly lifted her face so that her
friend could look down into her eyes.</P>

<P>"I think I'm almost sure of one thing," she whispered. She put her
lips to the warm palm of the hand that had drawn her near.</P>

<P>"Of what?"</P>

<P>"If I felt to a man as I feel to you I should know I loved
him."</P>

<P>Miss Phillipps's eyes flashed through a sudden dew. She smiled as
few ever saw her smile.</P>

<P>"My darling!" she said.
