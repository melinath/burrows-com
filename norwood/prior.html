         <P>An English Design. This pattern pays homage to the style
         of William Morris, the great 19th century English wallpaper
         designer. The foliage is reminiscent to "Larkspur" and the
         organization of the pattern, with a meander of foliage
         counterpointed by a grid of flowers, is like "Marigold," but
         this pattern has major and minor flowers set on the diamond
         points of a diaper pattern. The document colorway has soft,
         tertiary hues popular in the 1880s and early 1890s, when it
         was originally produced. It draws its inspiration from
         Morris without copying the master's work; it is a
         sophisticated design with its own character and integrity.
         Priory Garden was selected by Fred Holland Day for his
         father's bedchamber in the Norwood, Massachusetts, house.
         21" wide with a self match repeat of 11 7/8". 6 yard long
         rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England.
         Documentary coloring combines tertiary hues of sage, green,
         ochre and blue. </P>
