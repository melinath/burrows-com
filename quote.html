         <P>"Doubtless there will be some, in these days at least,
         who will say, 'Tis most helpful to me to let the bare walls
         alone.' So also there would be some who, when asked with
         what manner of books they will furnish their room, would
         answer, 'With none.' But I think you will agree with me in
         thinking that both these sets of people would be in an
         unhealthy state of mind, and probably of body also; in which
         case we need not trouble ourselves about their whims, since
         it is with healthy &amp; sane people only that art has
         dealings."</P>

         <P>On the subject of wallpapers: "And firstly, you must
         remember that it is a cheap art, somewhat easily done;
         elaborate patterns are easy in it; so be careful not to over
         do either the elaboration in your paper or the amount of
         pattern-work in your rooms. I mean, by all means have the
         prettiest paper you can get, but don't fall in love so much
         with the cheapness of its prettiness as to have several
         patterns in one room, or even two, if you will be advised by
         me."</P>

         <P>Echoed in America: "As a rule it is well not to overload
         the wall or ceiling of a private house with ornaments, but
         to keep to broad fields of color artistically mottled,
         shaded or textured. Ornaments, indeed, may and should be
         used in the frieze and upon the ceiling, but sparingly and
         with great care as to harmony of color and design. Elaborate
         ornamentation may be admissible in theatres and other public
         buildings, but in the decoration of a house everything
         should be of a restful nature."</P>
