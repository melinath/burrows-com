<P><FONT SIZE="+2">R</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">ANDY RANKIN</FONT> always
sits straight. She never lolls. As she sat there in the most
uncomfortable chair in the tent, she was a great contrast to us, who
came to the shore with intent to do nothing but lounge, and who
appeared to be accomplishing our intentions. I am sure there are some
people who are never comfortable save when they are uncomfortable. As
I reclined on our couch and looked at Mrs. Rankin, I could but wonder
if Mr. Rankin also always wanted to sit straight; if he did not, I
thought I had a clew as to why he should now live by himself in that
old schoolhouse, while she should dwell in the Two-mile. This woman
is considerably above the average native on these shores; it was
interesting to have her spend part of a day with us, but I could not
put from me the feeling that she might be somewhat overwhelming as a
constant companion. I noticed one peculiarity about her speech: she
would frequently speak correctly for several consecutive sentences,
and then would lapse with apparent hopelessness into a tangle of
subjects and predicates. I decided that she knew how to use the
simple laws of grammar, but that the custom and example of years were
generally more powerful than any other consideration.</P>

<P>At our request she had taken off her "things," which were a
black-fringed silk shawl and a sun-bonnet. A pair of large drab
cotton gloves had also been removed, and were pulled into each other
in the form of a ball, and placed in the sun-bonnet. Her dress was
black alpaca, which was so shiny as to look new; of course it was not
wrinkled' for alpaca cannot wrinkle. Although the cloth looked so
new, I felt that this appearance was deceptive, for I was sure that
not within thirty years at the very least could any dressmaker have
been persuaded to cut a "bodice" like that. Perhaps I may as well
state here that later I was informed by Mrs. Marlow that the dress
was new, had never been worn before, and was cut and made by Mrs.
Rankin herself. It was of that fashion once known as "the fan waist."
Those who have seen this style will know what I mean, and to those
who have not I can give no description which would be sufficiently
graphic. It was cut down in the neck, so that. a slight hint of the
collar-bone could be seen, and round this neck was "fulled on" a
strip of that Hamburg edging which is brought round in packs by Jew
peddlers. She wore a white apron with three tucks at the bottom, and
finished off with more edging.</P>

<P>Now, if you think Randy Rankin, in spite of her face and dress,
was one for whom you could feel anything like pity or condescension,
you are entirely mistaken. There was a grimness, a decision, and a
strength about her, a shrewdness and sense, that made it impossible
not to have a sort of respect for her. If sue chose to dress as she
did when she was young, you could only be amused; the conviction that
she would not care if you went into convulsions of laughter at her
made the convulsions impossible.</P>

<P>She was in the habit of relating some of the infelicities of her
married life with the matter-of-fact calmness with which any of the
fishermen here might tell of a poor haul at certain seasons. A poor
haul was unfortunate, but it was a subject which could be fully
discussed without any delicacy.</P>

<P>I have said that my walking across the floor of the tent with
slippers whose heels clacked at every step excited in our caller
reminiscence of her married life.</P>

<P>"It ain't no secret why Mr. Rankin and me can't live together,"
she said as she slowly drank her lemonade. "I never did believe in
mysteries, and when folks want to know the trouble I'm always willin'
to tell 'em. Mr. Rankin was so easy goin' 't I guess he could 'er put
up with me, or anybody, till the jedgment day, but my nerves can't
bear everything. There were two things that decided me." Mrs. Rankin
here spoke with extraordinary decision. "One was them
down-to-the-heel slippers. I d' know where he fished 'em up from;
under the eaves somewhere, I expect. 'T any rate, he come into the
kitchen one morning with them on. He wa'n't very well that day, 'n'
he stayed in the house, and kep' walkin' up and down, clack, clack,
clack, clack, across that oil-cloth, until I felt that I should fly.
I c'n bear some things well enough, but some things I can't; and Mr.
Rankin, one way'n' 'nother, had got to be awful tryin'. My teeth were
on edge most of the time. I said to him, 'Had n't you better put on
them list slippers o' yourn?' I went and got 'em, and put 'em down in
front of him. He did n't say he would n't put 'em on; that wasn't his
way; but all the same, he did n't do it, but kept on them things, and
kept walkin' and clackin' all that day. He wa'n't well for a week,
and the whole of that mortal time he wore them slippers, with heels
that had busted off the uppers jest far enough to let 'em down good
with every step. I s'pose you know there's always a last straw. I
concluded that I had about reached that straw, and I told Mr. Rankin
so. He laughed, and said he guessed not; he guessed things would go
on with us about as usual. Will you believe it, all the rest of the
time I lived with him, about six months, he would never wear any
other slippers but them! I had given the matter the most earnest
thought of which I was capable. I was fearful unhappy, and growin'
more so every day. The man's whole nature rasped on mine so that I
was sometimes afraid of myself when I saw him coming. And yet he was
an upright, honest man. I have nothing to say against his character.
He must have had his trials with me. Luckily for him, he had a thick
skin."</P>

<P>Mrs. Rankin paused, and seemed to be looking into the past. After
a moment she resumed:--</P>

<P>"But, for, 't ain't no use whining. Jonas Rankin's jest what he
is, 'n' I 'm jest what I be. I had made a firm resolution that them
slippers, even if he wore 'em's long '9 I lived, should n't be the
last straw. But I told him fair and square that the very next thing
would be. I 'd got to the end of my rope. He laughed. I guess that
laugh of his has made me as mad's I ever wanter be. I used to pray
over things. My health wasn't first-rate, and I've noticed prayer
seems to do more good when you're kind of sound bodily. No, don't
give me no more lemonade. Wall, what do you think that man did
next?"</P>

<P>Randy waited for us to guess, but, naturally, we did not fully
know the capabilities of Mr. Jonas Rankin, and so could make no guess
at all.</P>

<P>"The Tree of Death was the next thing," she said, with such an
intensity of utterance that we stopped the laugh that rose to our
lips, and waited with what patience we might.</P>

<P>"Yes," she went on." It belonged to his first wife, she that was a
Lincoln, and he said they used to have it in their parlor. This he
told me when we were first married. He gave it to his son, who lives
under the first cliff on the shore, you know. One day Mr. Rankin come
in with a large flat parcel under his arm. He took off the wrappings,
and said he guessed we'd have that in the sitting-room now. Then he
hung up the thing in a place where you'd see it, and nothing else, if
you were anywhere in the room. I begged him not to have it there.
There Noms nothing in the world I hated so much. Did you ever see
one?"</P>

<P>No, we never had seen one.</P>

<P>"It's a tall, black, dead-looking tree, with a horrible picture of
the devil tramping about the roots with a watering-pot, from which
great streams of water are running. The devil has cloven feet, horns,
and a tail with a prong to it. He is grinning because the tree is so
flourishing. For fruit there are great black balls, and in each ball
is printed the name of some sin, such as Lying, Theft, Lust,
Covetousness, and other sins which I need not mention. This picture
was in a frame of wood painted a light blue, with gilt sprigs on it.
What do you think? That man was bound to have the picture hung there.
He said the sight of it was wholesome for frivolous souls. I told him
that if we had ever been frivolous, it had all been taken out of us
long ago. He said he guessed it had better hang there. And I knew it
was settled. I found out afterward that John's little girl--John is
Mr. Rankin's son --had had fits just from looking at the Tree of
Death. I could believe that well enough, for the child was a nervous,
fanciful thing. She was frightened almost out of her senses. She
could n't keep away from the picture, either, and used to steal into
the room where it was, and stand and look at it. Finally her mother
found it out. Lily threw herself into her mother's arms one day, and
said that the devil was watering the sins in her heart, and soon they
would be as big as those black balls. Then she had a kind of
convulsion. That picture came down double quick. The doctor said that
child would be crazy if she were left to have such notions.</P>

<P>"Do you think I was goin' ter hev that blarsted thing there for me
ter stare at? No; that was the last straw. I told Mr. Rankin it was
the last straw. I wa'n't a-goin' ter keep house for him no more. He
tried ter argue the point. I told him he might save his breath. The
house happened ter be mine. I told him he might take his traps and
go. He had jest about enough int'rest money to git his victuals and
clothes, if he lived by himself. 'Jest keep yer int'rest,' says I.
'You jest row your own boat, and I'll row mine.' I guess there wa'n't
no love lost atween us. He took his things, or rusher his fust wife's
things, 'n' went an' bought an old schoolhouse that the town ain't
had no use for this dozen years. He paid fifty dollars for it. He's
lived there ever sence; be seven years next spring. I do some washin'
and some slop-work, and pick some huckleberries. I git 'long. I ain't
got no Tree of Death in my house, nor nobody that wears slippers that
click on the oil-cloth. I do Mr. Rankin's washing and mending, but I
don't charge him nothin' for it. I send the clothes back by the baker
every fortnit, and the grocery man brings 'em. I don't see Mr. Rankin
from year's end to year's end, and I don't want to. His son and I are
on good terms. John is a good fellow. I like him; and naturally
there's great sympathy between his family and me on the subject of
that picture. John's wife has been so far as to say that she didn't
blame no woman for not livin' with no man who wanted to put the Tree
of Death under her nose all the time. Of course I'm lonesome once in
a while. I often think, if my son had lived, 't would have been
different."</P>

<P>Mrs. Rankin became silent. Her deep set eyes seemed to look more
sunken than ever. She roused herself.</P>

<P>"Oh, yes," she said, "I git 'long."</P>
