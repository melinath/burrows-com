<P><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">UR</FONT> tent is up. Not
only up, but it has a board floor When Mrs. Yates went across Salt
Pond that day, in desperate pursuit of some man who would be willing
to work for a few hours, she was successful far beyond anything we
had hoped. When her dory was seen coming back, after a long absence,
it contained a man, and that man proved to be a carpenter. He
actually brought a few tools with him, and could use them without
complaining of being tired. As I had expected, Cap'n Asel lingered
near until he learned why Maria Jane had gone; then he limped away
over the ridge to tell the inhabitants that '' them women had got a
man to work for 'em finally, 'n' he guessed they 'd got a lesson now
not to come down here agin without no man."</P>

<P>Indeed, we had that lesson thoroughly learned.</P>

<P>The man worked leisurely, but to Maria Jane, accustomed to the
movements of her husband, this work seemed to be goin, on with
lightning-like rapidity. To use her own words in description
afterward "that tent was yanked up quicker 'n scat."</P>

<P>We felt that we deserved to have it reared in this way at last.
Mrs. Yates remained with us, and helped us unpack our scanty
furniture. For spectators we had, most prominent of all, the mastiff,
who sat gazing with so much calmness that he even occasionally nodded
in a short nap. There were two women from the house nearest, who
stood for hours with their aprons flung up in an artful manner over
their heads, their rough brown hands hanging before them, their eyes
not missing a single article as it was untied or unwrapped. On a line
with them was Cap'n Asel, who for some unaccountable reason was late
in arriving, but whose attention, after he did come, never wandered
for an instant. Occasionally, from the house up the slope of the hill
where the two women lived, three small children would wander down,
and make such statements as the following:--</P>

<P>"Ma! ma! The water's all b'iled outer the greens! "</P>

<P>"Ma! ma! The gingerbread's burnt as black's the back! "</P>

<P>"Ma! ma! I've cut my finger tryin' to skin them perch!"</P>

<P>"Ma! I say, ain't it time fur the chowder?"</P>

<P>These announcements were received usually with great stolidity,
and replied to in this wise:--</P>

<P>"Put more water in the pot's quick's ever you can."</P>

<P>"If it's a-burnin', shet the back damper."</P>

<P>"Lor! That cut ain't nothin'."</P>

<P>I was rather sorry for the children, for they wanted to stay and
see the tent furnished, and would stand in that openly spellbound
manner peculiar to children, until they were hustled off up to the
house, to remain until they could think of some other excuse to seek
their mothers' society.</P>

<P>The articles we were placing in the tent were of the simplest
description, but I could hardly believe that fact when I saw the
intense scrutiny with which they were all viewed.</P>

<P>We could not have been watched more closely had we been performing
the most extraordinary tumbling feats. I suppose there is almost
nothing in the way of entertainment for such women. They do not have
even the mild excitement of catching fish or of tending lobster-pots.
What they know is what their husbands tell them, and this source of
information is neither large nor deep. This particular place we had
chosen for our tent because it was removed from the cluster of little
summer cottages, which occupied the more picturesque portions of the
shore. But these houses and hotels were too far away for these women
to have a chance to give them much close inspection. It was the men
who, in the season, walked up to the summer dwellings with baskets of
fish and lobsters, and charged a startling price for their wares.
"The nigher you be to where fish is caught, the higher they naturally
be," said Cap'n Asel to me once, when I objected to paying more for a
codfish than I would have to do in a city market. "It's plain enough
why it should be so," he went on in an argumentative manner; "for,
you see, the nigher, the better the quality. A cod that was a-skitin'
through the briny half an hour ago's better than arter he's ben in a
icechist a day or two. Ain't that so? "</P>

<P>This was reasoning to which I had no reply.</P>

<P>It seemed an almost incredible thing to these people, particularly
the women that we, being women, could really be intending to live in
a tent, although it should have been plain to them that this
transient abode was really going to be more comfortable than the
homes where some of them dwelt.</P>

<P>"It might do well 'nough for men folks," said one doubtfully, "but
it don't seem proper, somehow."</P>

<P>The idea of propriety was before their eyes. "I should n't wonder
a mite if you got talked about," said this same woman "Randy Rankin
told me yisterday that 't wa'n't fittin' for you two to be here
alone. 'N' somehow it seemed wuss she said, "for ye to hev a dorg's
big as that. You see, we ain't used to no such dorg's that. It makes
the whole place kinder different to know that there's such a animil
round. Will he break inter folkses houses 'n' jump at folks in their
beds? "</P>

<P>"It is not his custom to do so, unless specially ordered," said
Carlos.</P>

<P>"Wall, Randy said dorgs o' them color, so kinder light, 'n' so
kinder dark round head, was of the breakin' - in kind. She thought it
needed a man ter tend ter him."</P>

<P>We assured our companion that Randy Rankin was entirely mistaken
in her judgment of dogs of "them color," and that her imagination
probably ''ran away with her" on this topic.</P>

<P>While we were making this explanation, it was discovered that our
kerosene cookstove was not present among the luggage. The tin oven
and various kettles had come, but the part of the stove which held
oil and produced heat was absent. This was a blow. How could we
"board ourselves" without this all-important article? And it would be
several days before an expressman could be notified and deliver it.
We began to feel as if Providence did not favor our project of
camping out on the South Shore.</P>

<P>Consulting with Mrs. Yates concerning this dilemma, she advised us
to see if we could not take our meals, until our stove came, with the
Widder Marlow, who lived at the east end of the ma'sh. The Widder
Marlow had two boarders now, folks who came early and stayed late
every year. The place was almost half a mile away, at the end of the
path which led along the ridge, and close to a salt marsh, which was
overflowed only at the highest tides of spring and fall. There were
times when this marsh sent forth such an odor that it would rouse us
from sound sleep in the middle of the night. It was a penetrating,
fetid, brimstone sort of an odor that was horribly suggestive. This
would come after a rain, and when the wind was in a particular corner
of the south. I never imagined anything could send out such a stench,
and was astounded when Cap'n Asel told us that "that smell was the
main thing which made this part of the shore so healthy. There wa'n't
no smell like it on the whole coast,"--this we believed;" 't was good
for the chist, 'n' 't was good for the stummick. Ef it had n't er ben
for that ma'sh smell, his lea 'd ben a good deal wuss'n' 't was."</P>

<P>There was in my mind often a suspicion that Cap'n Asel was not
talking what, as children, we used to call "honest Indian." I look at
him curiously to discover any sign of insincerity, but I have not yet
found any such sign. He is ignorant enough and selfconceited enough
not to know any better than he talks. It must be his solemnity that
makes me suspect him.</P>

<P>Maria Jane went with us that forenoon to Widow Marlow's. We had
risen so early, on account of Mr. Morse's wish to get into his barn,
that at eleven o'clock it already seemed as if it were a week since
that hour in the foggy morning twilight when I had accompanied Mr.
Morse as a protector against Max. Mrs. Marlow's residence was a two
story building, very straight and very narrow, with nothing whatever
to break its up-and-down look; even the windows and doors were
exactly flush with the surface, an effect which I never before saw
reached to such a monotonous degree. Of course there was not a tree,
for there are no trees in the vicinity. If you stay on this coast, it
is because of love for the sea and the gray rocks and grayer shore,
not for love of green trees or shrubs or grass. Except when the ocean
is green, there is an entire absence of that hue. The marshes never
have that color which is the characteristic of inland vegetation, but
they have their own restful shade.</P>

<P>Mrs. Marlow was cleaning her "front entry," when we arrived; she
was also giving orders through the space between that and the kitchen
to some one in the latter place, who was invisible, but who, we
judged, was making a chowder. Mrs. Yates related our story, and hoped
that Mrs. Marlow could give us our meals for a few clays. Mrs. Marlow
was a large woman, with more pretensions to dress than any person I
had yet seen here. She had a flounce on the bottom of her gown, and
one nearly as large about the neck.</P>

<P>She said that she was very much flustered by our sudden arrival,
and hoped we would excuse the looks of the front entry, but she "had
been hendered 'bout her cleanin' house. When the entry was clean 't
would have a different look. The picture of President Garfield," now
on the floor, with its back to us, "sort of set off the entry some,
when hung." She had a very deprecatory air, which we found later was
not entirely the effect of being caught cleaning house, but was
habitual. She finally said:--</P>

<P>"Wall, if you'll take us just as we be, you may come. Our regulars
come last week, 'n' we sha'n't have to cook much more for you
two."</P>

<P>She said that dinner would be ready at twelve exactly, and now we
were there we might as well come into the parlor and wait.</P>

<P>We went into the parlor, which room had the same general look
peculiar to the outside of the house. There were some pink and white
shells on the table; on the walls a very highly tinted picture of
Grace Darling in a very small boat just rising on the top of a very
large wave; and opposite, the carefully dried remains of a
cigar-fish. As Mrs. Marlow was leaving the room, she paused and
looked at us a moment in hesitation. Then she said:--</P>

<P>"Our regulars are Mr. Simms and his sister. They are very, very
nice people, strictly fust-class. But Mr. Simms is poorly in his
health, and consequently is low in his spirits; sometimes he's 'bout
as blue as a whetstone. You look's if you might be kind of lively; I
do wish you 'd try and chipper up Mr. Simms."</P>

<P>She closed the door, and went heavily along the now cleaned
entry.</P>

<P>Carlos looked at me a moment in silence. Then she asked if I
intended to chipper up Mr. Simms.</P>
