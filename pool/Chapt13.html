<P><FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">AVING</FONT> brought a
pistol with me to the residence of Mrs. Rankin, I do not believe I
can be blamed for wishing to know where the weapon had been put. But
my friend censured me severely. She said that she valued her life,
and made other remarks not calculated to soothe my mind. She informed
me that the reason she had felt it safe to stay in the tent with me
for so long was that I seemed to have forgotten that there was such a
thing beneath the same canvas with us. As she talked thus she was
lying nearly swallowed up in the embrace of an enormously thick
feather bed in the smallest bedroom which can be made. We are often
told admiringly of the superior physical condition of our ancestors;
how they could endure hardships, how tough they were, etc. Indeed,
they must have been tough who could live to maturity, if they passed
their nights in such little boxes as are these bedrooms which we find
in nearly all the very old houses in New England. Literally they are
boxes, with one small window, which in winter was rarely, if ever,
opened. If a boy or girl lived to grow up, it was surely a case, of
the survival of the fittest. The fact of one's being alive at all
after infancy was proof enough of toughness.</P>

<P>This was the kind of room in which we were to pass the night,--a
night so hot, now that every breath of wind had gone down, that only
a panting perspiring half-existence seemed possible. We thought of
our tent as of something very far away and unutterably comfortable in
contrast. The one diminutive window was open to its fullest extent,
but the mosquito netting draped across it did not stir a fold. If
there should be any breeze, you could be sure by looking at that
window that it would never come in that direction.</P>

<P>I waited in silence at the door while Carlos discoursed thus
cruelly. When she made a slight pause I left her to prosecute my
search. I had a kind of feeling-- "womanish" is, I suppose, the
adjective to apply to the feeling--that if that revolver were left
lying in some place unknown to me it might take it into its mind to
explode by itself, just from sheer depravity. I believe firearms
capable of such deeds. And then I had a curious, unreasonable
conviction that if burglars should come I could frighten them
terribly if I chose to do so. In fact, I should have the matter
entirely in my own hands.</P>

<P>I crept through the kitchen and out into the "sink-room," where I
had seen Randy take the bag. Randy had gone up-stairs to sleep, in a
room a trifle larger than the one she had given us, and a bide hotter
also, for the sun had been heating the roof all day, and to open the
"chamber-way door" was to receive a blast of air which made us almost
thankful for our down-stairs apartment.</P>

<P>I did not wish Randy to hear me. But every board in the floor
creaked maliciously, and I barely saved myself from tumbling over the
cat, which was curled up in an entirely unexpected place. This room
had a sink in one corner; across the other end was piled
systematically several tiers of wood ready for the stove. The rafters
and joists were bare and blackened, and bunches of herbs hung from
them. The whole place seemed seething in the memory of the sun which
had been shining on it all day, and the smell of pennyroyal and
thoroughwort was thick upon the air.</P>

<P>I held my lamp high' and looked about me. On a low stool which had
been pushed under the sink I saw the leather bag I had brought. Yes,
the pistol was in it. Now if it burst it should do so under my own
eye. I went back slowly, and found my friend had fallen asleep in my
absence.</P>

<P>The next few hours passed silently in hot darkness. I had not even
thought of sleeping. At least I shall always believe I had not slept.
Neither had I heard a sound, save the shrill noises of the
summer-night insects. A tree-toad, apparently on the window- sill,
two or three times uttered its strange, bubbling sort of cry,
prophesying rain.</P>

<P>Suddenly, close to my side, I heard Randy Rankin whisper.</P>

<P>"The house is surrounded by burglars," she said.</P>

<P>I sat up, and groped out toward where the voice came from.</P>

<P>"You must be mistaken," I whispered. "I have n't slept, and I have
heard nothing."</P>

<P>"I guess I know what I 'm talking about," she responded. "I tell
you we are surrounded. I'm goin' for that pistol of yourn. Which end
do you take hold of?"</P>

<P>Before I could say anything more she was in the next room, and I
dared not raise my voice. She knew the house so well that she could
manage to find her way in the dark.</P>

<P>My friend seized my arm with a painful clinch.</P>

<P>"Good heavens!" she cried in my ear. "She'll kill herself! Just
think of her firing the pistol from the wrong end! Oh, why did you
bring it?"</P>

<P>I hastened to assure Carlos that Randy was at present safe, for
she wouldn't find that revolver, since it was at this moment under my
pillow.</P>

<P>"Oh!" cried Carlos, with a spring away from me.</P>

<P>"As you have been sleeping so soundly near it, can't you compose
yourself when awake?" I asked; with some bitterness. Even if I were
not a first-class shot, I did not see why people should act as if I
had the pestilence when they knew a weapon was near me.</P>

<P>In a moment I was aware that my friend had crept out of bed. I saw
a dim, wavering figure going toward the door. I also rose as silently
as I could.</P>

<P>"Didn't you hear her say we are surrounded by burglars?" I
asked.</P>

<P>Carlos made a kind of hysterical sound, and then managed to tell
me that she did n't know which she feared most, a regiment of
burglars or me with a pistol. Then I asked her where she intended
going, and she said she wasn't going anywhere; she meant to lie down
on the floor, for she thought the floor was the safest place, as
whichever way I might fire, it was n't likely the bullet would go
that way.</P>

<P>"As for burglars," she went on in a shrill whisper, "I don't
believe a word about them. Have n't I been awake all the time? Randy
has had a nightmare. She went to bed with her mind made up that
burglars should come, and this is the result. Ah!"</P>

<P>"Oh!"</P>

<P>As these exclamations were uttered, we caught hold of each other
with eager fingers. Then Carlos disengaged my grasp, and silently
laid herself down on the braided rug in front of the bed.</P>

<P>"It's the best I can do," she said. "When you have a pistol I feel
just as I do in a thunder-storm; I never know where the lightning
will strike. What do you think it was that we heard? I can converse
while lying here just as well as anywhere."</P>

<P>We had certainly heard something. Impossible to tell whether the
noise was made by our hostess or by unknown assailants. We remained
perfectly still for some moments, I with the revolver in my hand. As
time passed we began to be anxious about Randy. She must have found
before this that the weapon she sought was not where she put it.
Things began to grow more and more mysterious. Mrs. Rankin appeared
to have been swallowed up.</P>

<P>At last my companion spoke: -</P>

<P>"Mind, I don't believe there's a burglar anywhere near here; but
if there is one, do you think he has chloroformed Mrs. Rankin? If you
will put your pistol down and swear not to touch it without warning
me, I will go with you to find Randy. It seems kind of cowardly to
stay here like this."</P>

<P>How could I relinquish my only means of defense? I hesitated, and
while I hesitated we heard another sound. Somebody was walking
deliberately by our bedroom window. It was a curious tread,--the
tread of two people, my friend insisted. We felt now that things were
beginning in earnest. Oh, where was Randy? I took a few steps out
into the suffocating darkness of the next room, and stood sniffing,
to learn if I could detect any odor of chloroform. Nothing.</P>

<P>I have no idea how much time passed as we lingered like poltroons,
while Mrs. Rankin might have been abducted and taken leagues away. I
was already beginning to wonder if we could raise a ransom for her;
and all that I had ever read of banditti went rioting through my mind
in helpless confusion. Finally I gave a solemn promise that if I
might be allowed to take my revolver, I would keep the hammer down on
an empty chamber, unless I gave due warning of a change.</P>

<P>In this arrangement I naturally forgot that if one wants to use a
pistol, the necessity is generally so urgent that there is scant
chance for explanation or warning.</P>

<P>We kindled our lamp, and I marched ahead with it. We went in
procession out through the kitchen, where odors of huckleberry slump
still lingered. Alas! Should we ever more eat huckleberry slump? I
was fast becoming so ruled by one idea that every scent smelled to me
like chloroform.</P>

<P>We paused often to sniff and to listen. The door into the
sink-room was slightly open. Randy must have come this way, for she
was going for the pistol she had hidden under the sink. Tremulously I
pushed open that door, holding my lamp extended, and feeling Carlos
pushing me from behind.</P>

<P>There was Randy, sitting flat on the floor in front of the sink.
She turned her wild eyes on us, as we came forward, and she lifted a
hand and said --</P>

<P>"Sh! Sh!"</P>

<P>We immediately obeyed, standing still and waiting</P>

<P>"They 've ben in here once 'n' got the pistol," she said, "'n' I
c'n hear um walkin'. See that busted screen. What 'd ye light a lamp
for?"</P>

<P>We saw the busted screen. Directly over the sink was a square
window, once covered by netting. This had been entirely torn off, the
shreds hanging to the tacks. The water-pail had been tipped over,
probably at the same time, and there was a large puddle of water
glittering in a hollow place on the floor. Randy's face was pale and
streaming with perspiration. She was dressed in a loose gown of faded
pink with sprigs on it. I shall never forget her as she sat there
waiting for burglars. I did not know then, and do not know now, why
she chose that position instead of any other. Her reasons must have
been good, for she had held the place ever since she had found that
the revolver was gone, instantly assuming that the burglars had taken
it.</P>

<P>Again we heard a noise outside.</P>

<P>"There they come again!" cried Randy, holding herself down on the
floor, as one holds one's self who is bathing in the ocean, and sees
a big roller rushing forward.</P>

<P>For an instant I hardly think any of us breathed. In that instant
something huge and tawny jumped in through the window, falling in its
leap a trifle beyond Mrs. Rankin, who huddled herself all up, but who
did not retreat an inch.</P>

<P>A great wave of relief and joy came over me. The being that had
thus entered came writhing and wriggling its great body up to us, and
deprecatingly licked our hands, whining gently as it did so.</P>

<P>It was Max.</P>

<P>I set my lamp down in a pool of water, and went on my knees that I
might more conveniently hug him.</P>

<P>"Oh land!" cried Randy, rising and drawing her skirts closely
about her, as if there were a mouse in the room. "I declare, I s'pose
he's the feller that's ben a-surroundin' this house all night. I wish
you'd shet him up tight somewhere. I d' know which I'd rusher have,
him or a burglar. But who took the pistol?" in an access of
alarm.</P>

<P>I told her. She seemed a little chagrined at the collapse of her
theory. But she only said she guessed "the dorg was oneasy at bein'
alone in the tent," and had scented us out.</P>

<P>Max went to our bedroom with us, and he slept, and snored, and
dreamed in calm content until morning.</P>

<P>At breakfast Randy said she thought "p'r'aps it might be jest as
well for us not to say anything about them burglars;" and we agreed
with her. We expressed our regret that we, who had come to protect
her, should have been the cause of felonious breaking and
entering.</P>
