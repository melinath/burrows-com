<P><FONT SIZE="+2">"I </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">ONLY</FONT> make just as
much coffee as you want, for if you leave any I have to drink it, and
it hurts me."</P>

<P>We were taking dinner with the woman who lives on the side of the
hill near where our tent is pitched. When the first month had passed,
we saw that she had decided that, in spite of living in a tent and
having no protector but a mastiff, we were respectable women. She had
been kind from the first, and intensely curious all the time, but
after four weeks she began to invite us to spend the day with her. We
did not want to go, and we excused ourselves until we could do so no
longer.</P>

<P>"Time was a-passin'," she informed us, "and here 'twas into
August; and 'fore we know it you two'll be a-packin' up and leavin',
'shout makin' me that visit."</P>

<P>Ah, yes, time was passing. Her words gave us a pang. But we hoped
there were yet two weeks, at least, before us here.</P>

<P>Mrs. Lemuel Hatch ("Miss Lem," as she was called all through the
Ridge, to distinguish her from half a dozen other Hatches dwelling
near) gained our promise to spend the day with her. She said Mrs.
Marlow's niece, "she that's ben so edicated, you know, was a-comin',
too. She was visitin' at her aunt's at the end of the ma'sh, and
she'd sent over for her." Mrs. Lem sat down again as she said this,
and put her hands on her knees as she bent forward gazing at us.
"She's ben to her aunt's for a couple of weeks, I guess. I s'pose you
've heard of Malviny Litchfield, ain't ye?"</P>

<P>Yes, we had heard Mrs. Marlow speak of her.</P>

<P>"Wall, Malviny's got more book-learnin', I s'pose, than I could
ever expect to shake a stick at. She went through everything in these
parts, and then she went through Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, and
came out a-flyin'. I've heard it said that ef a gal goes through that
seminary it's about certain she'll marry a missionary. I can't tell
how true that is, but I do know that Malviny got engaged to a
missionary jest in her last term. You see, he had ben out to Burmah,
and had lost two wives out there. Nat'rally he come back for another
one. Burmah seemed to agree with him, but did n't seem to agree with
his wives. He was engaged to Malviny, as I said. But something
happened; I never knew jest what 't was. Malviny had begun to study
the Burmah tongue, and there was great talk up 'n' down the Ridge
'bout the Lord havin' called her to teach the heathen. Miss Marlow
was consid'able set up, and I don't blame her any; I sh'd ben set up
myself if any of my relatives was calkilatin' to marry a missionary.
But it fell through. All to once he had married another Mount Holyoke
girl, and had actually sailed. Malviny 's ben teachin' here and there
ever sence. She's a assistant in some boardin'-school now. They say
she knows everything. I've seen handsomer women than she makes, but I
don't s'pose there 's a likelier gal in the State than Malviny
Litchfield. Now, don't go to bein' late; come early, and we'll have a
good, long, sociable day."</P>

<P>So Mrs. Lem left us to think of the morrow and of the girl who had
almost been a missionary's "helpmate."</P>

<P>It was when Mrs. Lem was getting dinner that she came to the door
of the sitting-room and asked us how much coffee we were in the habit
of drinking, and then told us that when there was any of this
beverage left she had to drink it to save it, and it hurt her. It was
now after eleven o'clock. Dinner would be precisely at twelve. The
fish were frying and tile potatoes boiling, and Miss Litchfield had
not come yet. We had given her up. Mrs. Lem said something must have
happened. But the coffee was put on to steep, with an allowance for
Malviny. Suddenly the youngest girl, aged five, burst into the house,
and announced that Miss Litchfield was jest a-comin' up the Ridge
from the ma'sh. A moment after we heard sounds of talk and
explanation in the kitchen, and then the new-comer was ushered into
the room where we sat stiffly in straight chairs.</P>

<P>I don't know what I had expected to see, but I immediately knew
that it had been something very different from this. Miss Malvina
Litchfield was no longer in her first youth. She was short and very
plump, and she had protruding eyes of so light a blue that they were
extremely bewildering. Her mouth was small and thin-lipped, and of
that kind which makes you involuntarily begin to nip your own mouth
in when you see it.</P>

<P>She had a retreating chin and a slight blonde mustache. She was
altogether so blonde that all her colors seemed to have faded. She
was dressed in a gray gown, so tight that the seams appeared to be in
that stage that immediately precedes bursting. But I think that Miss
Litchfield's discipline over all her surroundings was such that the
seams never would really burst. She had a decided baritone voice, and
such a voice is always peculiarly startling when coming from a fair
"complected" woman. She uttered each word with painful distinctness,
and she sounded "ng" with an absolute ring, evidently fearing that if
she did not do that way she should omit the sound altogether, as she
had probably done when she was a child. Every sentence she spoke was
as if she were explaining something abstruse to a stupid child. She
shook hands with a long-continued circular motion, very fatiguing to
the recipient of this greeting.</P>

<P>"It gives me extreme pleasure to meet you two ladies," she said,
sitting down opposite and looking intently at us. "I understand you
have been passing the season quite primitively in a tent on this
shore."</P>

<P>"Yes, quite primitively," murmured Carlos, looking much confused.
As for me, I had not an idea in my mind. That voice, those eyes, the
strained seams of that gray waist, the explanatory manner, quickly
made me idiotic. I expected momentarily that she would ask me if I
could tell her what county I lived in, or who was the first President
of the United States; and, for the first time since the age of seven,
I could not have replied to those questions correctly. Until I heard
her talk I did not know there were in the language so many words
ending in the syllable "ly," and hearing her, I felt as if I would
hereafter try to get along without any adverbs. She said the sun
shone very prettily on Salt Pond, and that the sail-boats there moved
gracefully; she thought our tent contrasted quite prettily with the
green grass around it. I find myself confused in trying to write down
what she said, for she had a completely stultifying effect on me, and
I saw that my friend was fast lapsing into blankness. We were
grateful when we were summoned to dinner. This meal was eaten in a
silence unbroken save by the sentences from Miss Litchfield. She ate
and drank with extreme correctness; the food disappeared from her
plate with a kind of mathematical precision which made me think, in
some crazy kind of a way, of cube root and ratios.</P>

<P>Mr. Lemuel Hatch dined with us. He did not speak once, and made no
social sign of any kind beyond nodding his head at us all when he
came in and sat down at the table. His appetite seemed good, and he
kindly kept shoving different kinds of food toward us. Although his
conversational powers did not appear to be great at that time, he had
a good-natured face with keen eyes, and I thought it might be
possible that his vocal organs were paralyzed by the presence of Miss
Litchfield.</P>

<P>I drank more coffee than I wanted, because I discovered by Mrs.
Lem's distressed -face, when she raised the coffee-pot, that there
was more than enough to go round; consequently there would be some
left, and she would have to drink it from economical motives, and
would be made ill thereby.</P>

<P>We were not long at the table. Mr. Hatch ate with astonishing
rapidity, and suddenly pushed his chair back, rose, and walked out of
the room. At this time we were all eating huckleberry pie; Mrs. Lem
remarked that her husband was in a hurry to go to his pawts. In five
minutes more we had all risen, and the three guests were back in the
sitting-room.</P>

<P>It seems to me that I never heard so much conversation as Miss
Litchfield poured out in the next hour. Her jaws opened and shut with
that same kind of mysterious mathematical movement she had employed
when eating and drinking. She instructed us without the usual
"recess" that she must have been obliged to give her regular pupils.
In the last half hour she got upon the subject of foreign missions.
She said that at one time in her life it had seemed to her that
Providence was leading her in the direction of a work in Burmah. She
had then prayerfully, hopefully, and cheerfully begun the study of
that language. She had also laid out a plan for the daily life of
such heathen as, in the Providence of God, might come under her care.
She had worked some mottoes quite prettily in green and purple
crewels on a yellow background. The colors had really contrasted very
artistically. She thought she might some time appropriately use them
in a Sabbath-school. Heaven, in its wise plans, had decreed that the
intention of going to Burmah should not come to fruition.</P>

<P>As she told us this in her deep voice, gazing at us with her
almost colorless eyes, I had a desperate feeling that in another
moment I might not be able to control the desire to rush indecorously
from the room. I glanced at my friend. Her whole face seemed to be
glazing over in some way, and she sat with her hands clasped tightly
in her lap.</P>

<P>"I had supposed, until quite recently," went on Miss Litchfield,
"that my whole future was to be devoted to educational purposes. Now,
however, the way seems opening in a different direction, and I trust
I may be able to be useful to one who stands critically in need of a
near and dear friend."</P>

<P>We murmured something, and she continued, branching out from that
subject into a perfect labyrinth of adverbs. These adverbs elude me
when I try to catch them, as I have said, but they fell glibly off
her tongue.</P>

<P>The afternoon passed, as all things do. As early as possible we
started home.</P>

<P>The next 'morning we were strolling along the beach with Maria
Jane Yates; we were all gathering Irish moss, which an east wind had
thrown up. Greatly to our surprise, we met Mr. Simms in his gray
suit, and by his side was Malvina Litchfield. She was talking, of
course.</P>

<P>Like a flash came into our minds her hope that she might be useful
to one who stood critically in need of a near and dear friend. We
repeated these words to Mrs. Yates, who tossed her head.</P>

<P>"I thought you knew," she remarked. "They've ben engaged this
three days. She 's gittin' ready to be married; weddin' the last of
this month."</P>

<P>"Poor Mr. Simms!" said I involuntarily.</P>

<P>"I d' know 'bout that," she said, "but I'll bet a cent he 'll hev
something besides his liver to think of. I expect she's a mighty good
woman."</P>

<P>"Then please give me a bad one," said Carlos with emphasis.</P>

<P>Maria Jane looked at us quizzically.</P>

<P>"You'd better be careful," she advised, "or if you talk like that,
folks 'll be a-sayin' you're runnin' down Malviny 'cause she's caught
Mr. Simms. I do declare, Malviny come to visit her aunt jest in the
nick of time."</P>
