<P><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">AP'N ASEL</FONT> has met
with an adventure. The result of that adventure is that he has been
obliged to give up wearing his everyday coat, because it is a ruin.
He is now to be seen in a very long garment of the cut styled the
Prince Albert, which gives him an air of being in a sort of demi-full
dress: it is very confusing to see him thus. This coat, I understand,
was given him some years ago by one of the summer visitors to the
shore, and has until now been held sacred to such times as Cap'n Asel
was obliged to attend funerals. He never goes to church, and has no
public entertainment of any kind now save that afforded him by
funerals: as the permanent population here is not large, and the
smell from the ma'sh is very "healthy," there are not many deaths in
the course of a year. My friend and I have become convinced that we
have been a great boon to Cap'n Asel. Since we came to this shore he
has kept up an unintermittent watch over us. I should not perhaps use
that adjective, for there have been periods of time when he has been
obliged to leave us, that he might go through the neighborhood and
report minutely as to what he had found out about "them two women and
their tent."</P>

<P>Not until yesterday did we know that as soon as he had discovered
that we were to take our meals at the Widow Marlow's, which of course
was immediately, he had expressed his belief to all along the ridge
that one of us would be "a-settin' her cap for Mr. Simms." He is one
of that large number of people who know, beyond the possibility of a
doubt, that every unmarried woman always, to a more or less degree,
"sets her cap" for every unmarried man she meets. It would be a
curious and interesting thing to discover exactly what is thought of
marriage in a mind like Captn Asel's.</P>

<P>It was against the Cap'n that he was not on good terms with Mrs.
Marlow. Had he been in her good graces, he would have invited himself
to a meal at her table, and would then and there have made his
observations regarding Mr. Simms, and afterward have published his
conclusions. Mr. Simms did not have to work for a living, and did not
subsist on charity: therefore that gentleman was, as Cap'n Asel put
it, "mighty well off; mighty 'forehanded." Of course any woman would
"e'en a'most jump out of her skin to git him." Nothing on this earth
could have persuaded the old man otherwise. It was surely not worth
while to try to persuade him.</P>

<P>As I have said, it was hard on him that he could not actually see
us in the presence of Mr. Simms. Every time we met Cap'n Asel,--and
that was every time we stepped out of the tent,--he took occasion to
mention something about "that feller that boarded at the end o' the
ma'sh," and he would look at us with wooden persistence to see how we
took his remarks. This soon became very wearing, but there seemed no
way of avoiding the infliction.</P>

<P>It was after we had been two or three days at Mrs. Marlow's that,
as we came out of the house,--where we had just had our supper, at
which meal we had been late, --Mr. Simms was sitting in a
rocking-chair by the door. He must have been free from nightmare for
the last night and have been in excellent spirits, for he went so far
as to remark voluntarily that it was a fine night, and he lifted his
hat as we left him. This behavior was almost startling to us, though
I am not sure that we considered that he was "courting." As we
started to wade through the sand I raised my eyes, and saw Cap'n Asel
leaning on his crutches. I knew immediately that he had been a
witness to this tell-tale love scene. He began to hobble along beside
us.</P>

<P>"I tell um," he said, "that there could n't no woman do better.
What's dyspepsy? Lor, who's a-goin' to mind dyspepsy? He wants his
mind taken up; sorter occypied, ye know."</P>

<P>We began to walk so fast that it was impossible for him to keep
near us. He fell behind, muttering something about our being so
shy.</P>

<P>That evening the carpenter who had pitched our tent came over to
talk about some shelves we had ordered to be put up. It had been
moonlight of late, and we were sitting within our tent with no other
illumination than that given by the moon, which poured in at the
entrance, across which we had mosquito - netting carefully draped.
When the carpenter entered, Max was sitting placidly on his haunches,
not far away.</P>

<P>In a few moments I heard the sound of slow-moving feet crunching
in the pebbles; then I forgot the sound. In two minutes more,
however, there was a low, remonstrant growl which I knew came from
Mnx. More crunching at the rear of the tent; more growling. I did not
think it best to interfere. If any one were prowling there, I was
fully convinced that Max could give a better lesson without my
interference.</P>

<P>We tried to continue our conversation about shelves, but the talk
lagged, and we all gave ourselves up undisguisedly to listening. For
a short time there was entire silence; then suddenly a noisy scramble
among the stones; a fall and a rattle, as of wood striking the
shingles; another more decided growl, followed by these forcible
words:--</P>

<P>"Tarnation cuss that dorg!"</P>

<P>Entire silence now, save for a very slight sound as of the tearing
of rotten woolen cloth.</P>

<P>We had by this time all risen to our feet, and were looking at
each other. The carpenter seemed to think he ought to be the first to
go out, but he said he "was n't afraid to own he was afraid of that
dog; but he would try to stand by us against any human critter."</P>

<P>Having thus stated his position, he brought up the rear as we
filed carefully past the mosquito-netting.</P>

<P>My friend and I reached the scene of the catastrophe at the same
moment, and the carpenter stood behind, looking over our heads. The
moon was very bright and there was no fog; therefore we had no
difficulty in taking in the details of the picture.</P>

<P>There was a man lying motionless on his face, behind the tent and
close to it. Near him lay two crutches, and over him stood Max,
looking extremely large and protective. The dog was holding in his
mouth an extensive shred of the back of the man's coat, the end of
the fragment being still attached to the garment.</P>

<P>Of course we knew the man immediately. It was Cap'n Asel. We
called Max away, but it was some time before we could persuade that
prone figure to stir. He kept asking, with his mouth still in the
sand, "Be ye sure the dorg ain't there ?"</P>

<P>At last the carpenter lifted the Cap'n to his leg and his
crutches. He had n't any back to his coat; or rather the back was
removed from its proper place, and hung down in a very useless
manner. When tile old man was at last placed on his usual supports,
and seemed capable of coherent speech, we asked him if he were hurt.
We felt tolerably sure that he was not, for the mastiff is very
unwilling to put his teeth into human flesh.</P>

<P>" I sh'll prosecute ye," was the reply.</P>

<P>Cap'n Asel continued to repeat this remark until we had lost all
interest in it. The carpenter left us, and we were still standing
behind our tent with Cap'n Asel, and he was still telling us he would
prosecute us.</P>

<P>"We understand fully what you intend to do," I said at last,
entirely out of patience. "But before you prosecute I wish you would
tell why you were sneaking at the back of the tent, instead of coming
round to the front."</P>

<P>"'Cause," he answered boldly," I did n't care nothin' 'bout comin'
in, 'n' I heard a man's voice, 'n' I jest thought I 'd find out if it
was that feller that boards to the Widder Marlow's,--that feller that
ye both was a-smirkin' at so when ye left him to-night. I didn't know
but you'd got him to come a-courtin'."</P>

<P>'And you forgot the dog?" I said.</P>

<P>"Yes," he answered grimly, "I forgot the dorg."</P>

<P>Then he informed us again that he intended to prosecute us.</P>

<P>At this stage of the incident a tall figure came slouching slowly
up the hill. It had a basket on its arm, and we soon saw that the
new-comer was Marsh Yates. Max ran wagging toward him, for Max had
from the first been very friendly with Yates. It naturally happened
that Marsh heard the expression of Cap'n Asel's intentions. After
setting down his basket, Marsh looked about for something to lean
against. Not finding anything, he put his hands in his pockets and
stood on his left foot. Then he asked in the laziest kind of a way
"what 'n' thunder the row was about." Before any one could reply he
remarked:--</P>

<P>"Seems to me, Cap'n, you've lost a slice outer yer coat. Ben
a-fightin'? "</P>

<P>These words made the Cap'n raise one crutch belligerently, and
repeat fiercely his former remark concerning his intentions.</P>

<P>Carlos gave Marsh a rapid recital of what had happened. The
fisherman threw back his head and laughed in such a way that we both
joined him heartily. Then he told the old man he'd better make sail
for home along with him, and the two men went away together. Marsh
turned to shout back:--</P>

<P>"Them lobsters in the basket are for you folks. We had 'em left
over, and did n't know but you 'd relish 'em between meals."</P>

<P>As we had lobster put before us three times a day, we had some
doubts about relishing "'em between meals," but we were grateful for
Marsh's kindness.</P>

<P>When Carlos related at the supper-table, last night, the tale of
Cap'n Asel's mishap, --with important reservations concerning a
gentleman present,--there came upon the face of Mr. Simms the nearest
approach to a smile which we have yet seen there. Was it possible
that he was going to allow himself to be "chippered up"? But I had
scarcely asked that question of myself before a creeper gloom came
over that cadaverous countenance, and I knew that he was wondering if
the hot doughnuts were going to distress him.</P>

<P>Meanwhile Cap'n Asel wears a Prince Albert coat, and we are not
yet prosecuted. On the contrary, he seems to bear no malice, but is
always near enough to know all our movements, and if there is
anything he does not fully understand he is not too diffident to make
inquiries. He hats, moreover, taken to bringing fish-heads and other
tokens of amity, which he offers to Max, who accepts all, but with an
air as if his acceptance were, to speak legally, "without prejudice."
The mastiff claims the privilege of still having his own
opinions.</P>
