<P><FONT SIZE="+2">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">HILE</FONT> we waited for
dinner in the parlor at Mrs. Marlow's, we felt ourselves becoming
saturated with the combined odor of boiling and frying fish. I
believe the wise men have decided that fish does not particularly
nourish brain any more. In that case, the people who live at the
shore, and eat fish because they must eat something, have very little
compensation now, while in the past they could console themselves by
thinking of the growth of their brains. Still, the theory at present
being promulgated by psychical research, that if you concentrate your
mind in the determination that you are well, why, then, you are well,
may be of use in the case of people residing by the sea and compelled
to subsist on fish. Let them focus their minds on these two
assertions: "I like fish as food," and "Fish makes my brain larger,"
and these assertions will become facts in these individual cases.</P>

<P>My friend and I unconsciously fell into such talk as this when we
had taken five meals at Mrs. Marlow's, on the edge of the ma'sh. We
talked in this way that we might strengthen our endurance of our bill
of fare. For breakfast we had griddle cakes, which Mr. Simms called
flannel cakes, and which his widowed sister, Mrs. Waters, pronounced
flan-<I>nel</I>, with a strong accent on the last syllable. Mrs.
Waters might have been educated, or at least "finished," by Mrs.
General, of "prunes and prisms" fame, if judged from her way of
speaking. She wished to convey the belief that she had a good deal of
money, but it was difficult to explain why a person of large means
should choose to come every season and board at Mrs. Marlow's. In her
personal appearance she was so shiny and neat that it almost made an
ordinary mortal feel dirty to look at her, the contrast was so
strong. She twiddled her knife and fork in such a fine sort of a way
that it was a wonder she had opportunity really to eat anything; she
never lifted her cup or her teaspoon to her lips without sticking her
little finger out nearly straight. I think this attitude of the hand
is an unfailing sign that the person is "genteel." She did not
enunciate very clearly, but she accented common words in a variety of
remarkable ways, thus revealing her gentility still more. She had a
son in France. He had gone in behalf of a wholesale dry-goods house
with which he was connected. She talked a great deal about my son
Francis, stress of tone on the last syllable. She had always just had
a letter from him, or was momentarily expecting one. Francis was
already thirty-five years of age, and he had never married. This she
told us while we were waiting for our second meal at this house. She
came into the parlor a moment after we had arrived. When she
announced this bachelor condition of her son we both said, "Indeed,"
and put on that inane look of interest which we may have seen on the
faces of people to whom we have been talking. We saw how clean she
was; we saw that there was not a hair out of place, either in her own
tresses or the frizzed front she wore; naturally we felt how tumbled
and dusty we were.</P>

<P>She was knitting some very wide edging with some very fine cotton;
this work she carried in an unwrinkled, large white handkerchief.</P>

<P>"No, he does not marry," she said. "He is too fastidious. I have
often told him that he must not expect to find any one absolutely
perfect. When I say that, he always replies, 'But we cannot help
looking for perfection.' "</P>

<P>Here I rose, and went and examined the cigar-fish on the wall, and
Carlos asked if Mr. Waters were in Paris.</P>

<P>"He is there with great frequency," was the answer. Then Mrs.
Waters added, as if her duty forced her, "He never says Paris; he
always says Par-ee."</P>

<P>Carlos murmured something to the effect that we Yankees must be
pardoned if we continued to say Paris. I do not know how much more
instruction we might have received had not the bell for supper
sounded then. For supper we always had two kinds of pie and some
variety of "preserve;" often this latter was made of the wild beach
plum. We had cold bread also, and hot biscuit frequently. I say
always, for we came to know correctly what " Mis' Marlow's victuals
was." These victuals were rather famous; among the natives here Mrs.
Marlow was described as a woman who "set a mighty good table." The
food was abundant, but the " hearty kind," as they called it, was
served with a good deal of fat pork. All kinds of fresh fish were
dipped in Indian meal and fried in pork; the chowders were made on a
foundation of fried pork which was sizzling in the bottom of a large
boiler, and the potatoes and chunks of fish added to it, with a
proportion of water and milk. We wished they would sometimes simply
boil a cod or a " haddick," and let us eat it with butter, but that
way of cooking seemed never thought of. Lobster was invariably on the
table, even at supper. Lobster warm from the boiling is, as I may
have said before, delicious. But even the ambrosia of Jupiter would
pall upon the palate if placed before one three times a day. And
there were clams. When we had a clam dinner we had nothing else; but
we had clams fried, boiled "plain,"--and in this latter way they were
very plain indeed,--and clam chowder. I have heard it said
authoritatively that there is no nourishment in clams. I am not
prepared to give my opinion on that assertion, but I can state from
actual experience that there is a vast amount of indigestibility in
clams. If you are liable to attacks of dyspepsia, avoid clams.</P>

<P>I speak in this comprehensive manner about Mrs. Marlow's table
because our kerosene stove did not arrive, and we took our meals
there for several days longer than we had expected to be obliged to
do. Either the expressman to whom we had sent to bring the stove did
not get our message, or he did not think it worth while to obey it at
present. It almost began to seem as if Marsh Yates had cast a spell
over us, and that we should never succeed in really accomplishing
anything we intended.</P>

<P>We spend a large part of our time either in going to our meals or
coming from them. As the path we are obliged to follow is over very
heavy, deep sand, which seems to pull us back constantly, we get a
great deal of exercise, and that is undoubtedly good for us. This
exercise and the delightful salt air make it possible for us to
devour things in the way of food that amaze us when we come to think
of them. We are not much more particular than our mastiff, who, I
should have said before, is a " mealer" also; only he is left on
guard at the tent, and when we return we bring him a confused mixture
of chowder and fried fish in a tin pail.</P>

<P>During the small portion of time when we are not somewhere between
our tent and Mrs. Marlow's we are usually asleep. This is not a
highly stimulated mental life, but it is a state which makes such a
life possible in the future.</P>

<P>Sometimes we are awake long enough to say to each other that the
ocean is superb to-day, or the water is sullen to-night; or we wish
we could remember what it was that Byron said to the sea. We
confidently expect to come out of this stupor and be sentimental
about our life by the restless waters. At present, however, we live
only to eat and sleep. Our life and the life of Max appear to be on a
level, so far as one can judge; save that Max has the duty of
watching to perform, and we appear to have no duties.</P>

<P>I was going to speak of Mr. Simms, for he has been in my mind ever
since our first meal with him. He has never been married: whether
from fastidiousness, as in the case of his nephew, I do not know. He
is habitually, as Mrs. Marlow confided to me, not only as "blue as a
whetstone," but as "down to the heel as a bootjack." Having told us
this, she further said it was a case of the "wust kind of
dyspepsy,--that kind where a man eats like a hog, but is thin as a
rail."</P>

<P>Our own observation had confirmed the truth of this last remark.
Mr. Simms was a great eater, and he was long and lank, with a very
small head, shaved face, and closely cropped hair. He never smiled.
While at table he was too busy to smile, and when not at table I
suspect he was too much occupied in watching to discover if what he
had eaten was going to "disagree with him." "But for," said Mrs.
Marlow once, when out of patience, "one thing agrees with him jest as
well as another. I do believe his stummick wouldn't know the
difference between an egg and a flat-iron."</P>

<P>"What my brother needs is cheerful society," said Mrs. Waters to
us on the third day, just as we were preparing to go over the sand
after our dinner." I wish you ladies would come into the parlor a few
minutes and converse."</P>

<P>"Yes," said Mrs. Marlow from the entry, " do go in and chipper up
Mr. Simms. He wants chipperin',--that's what he wants."</P>

<P>Mrs. Waters continued to urge us, until we went in, feeling vague
longings that we might successfully chipper him up, and vague
rebellious feelings against being made to do so in this way. I had
also a fleeting thought that I was like a monkey sent in to caper
before a sick child. If you have ever been bidden to converse, you
know how impossible it immediately seems to utter a word.</P>

<P>Mr. Simms was sitting in the only comfortable chair in the room.
Of course he kept the chair. Carlos, who has a flow of words upon
occasion and can be amusing, was soon telling some ludicrous phase of
our experience since we came to the South Shore. Mrs. Waters laughed
and I laughed, but Mr. Simms did not relax a muscle of his face. The
moment Carlos ceased speaking, he turned to his sister and
said:--</P>

<P>"Sarah, I think from the way my liver feels that the lobster for
dinner was caught a little, just a little, too young. I should not be
one particle surprised if I had nightmare to-night."</P>

<P>After this remark there was a short silence, soon broken by Mrs.
Waters anxiously advising a certain powder which the doctor had
ordered for incubus. I don't think she thought nightmare a strictly
proper word for a lady to use, though permissible for a
gentleman.</P>

<P>When we had got ourselves out of the room, my friend said that she
didn't know as she cared if Mr. Simms had incubus quite often. She
did n't know but she hoped he would have incubus hard that very
night. And she expressed a resolve that, if she lived to be a hundred
years old, she would never again try to chipper up Mr. Simms.</P>
