<P><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">E</FONT> were not likely
to forget that the wife of Marsh Yates gave us shelter on the first
night we spent at the South Shore this season. As we occupied the
only bed in the house, I wondered in what way our entertainers passed
the dark hours. The cracks opening from our door to the floor below
let up the sound of a great deal of snoring, so that my conscience
did not afflict me as it might otherwise have done. It seemed to me
in the middle of the night that some one said in a dream:--</P>

<P>"You'll have ter git up. Git up, I tell you!"</P>

<P>I tried to rouse myself. There was a glimmer of daylight filling
the outside fog. Those words about getting up sounded again from the
foot of the stairs which led into this chamber where we slept. And
now the head of Maria Jane Yates appeared in the aperture left in the
Door boards that the stairs might come through.</P>

<P>"The man wants ter git into his barn," said Maria Jane
impressively.</P>

<P>"Tell him to go into his barn," I said with equal impressiveness,
but vaguely, as one who still half sleeps.</P>

<P>"You'll have ter git yourself awake and dress, for he's waitin'
now," announced the voice. "I'd jest as lieves go, so fur's I'm
concerned," it added, "ef you say so."</P>

<P>How dreadful it is to waken in the midst of the first sound sleep
you have had all the night ! I could not imagine what all this talk
was about, but I made a mighty effort and got up. I then heard the
mumble of a man's voice--not Marsh's--below, and thought I heard the
word "dorg" pronounced with an unpleasant emphasis. Maria Jane nodded
at me.</P>

<P>"The dorg, ye know," she said. "Mr. Morse could n't git into his
barn to feed his calf, nor nothin', 'cause your dorg is there. He
says it's hendered him fifty cents' wuth a'ready, for he meant to
have started early for the salt hay he bought at the harbor."</P>

<P>Now I was awake. It did not seem two minutes until I was walking
over the ridge with Mr. Morse, and striving to keep up with his
enormous strides. The fog was so thick I could barely see my
companion, and the air was so salt I could taste it on my lips. The
tide was going out, I knew by the long-drawn, sucking gurgles it made
among the loose stones at my left, where Stony Beach curved its
little stretch between its rocky boundaries. In such a mist as this
one knew very little about the time of sun-rising. I felt that I was
paying too dear for having a dog to protect our property.</P>

<P>"Thought you was goin' ter git yer tent up and git settled
yisterd'y," said Mr. Morse</P>

<P>over his shoulder at me, as I scrambled breathless just at his
heels.</P>

<P>"So I thought; we engaged Mr. Yates to put it up," I replied,
gasping.</P>

<P>"I could have told ye better 'n that," said Mr. Morse, as people
always say when it is too late. He laughed hoarsely. "Guess he did
n't have time, did he?" Then he laughed again. "I c'n tell ye one
thing," he said, suddenly facing round on me, the mist making him
look like a giant: "you never 'll git that tent up ef you wait for
Marsh Yates to do it." Then he turned, and threw the following words
at me from his shoulder: "'N' I don't see's I c'n have that dorg on
my premises, a-guardin' of other folks' property, much longer. It
don't make a man feel pleased ter go out ter his own barn and find a
dog's big as an ox set'n' on his tail an' grinnin' at ye, so' s't ye
feel obliged to run if ye vally your life. 'N' I ain't prepared ter
die yet,--not by means of a dorg in my own barn."</P>

<P>I could not but agree with these sentiments. I told Mr. Morse,
perhaps rather more profusely than was necessary, that I agreed with
him, and that I should try and make it all right with him. Let me say
here that you are always committing yourself rashly when you say to a
countryman, whether of the shore or inland, that you ''will make it
all right with him.'' He immediately thinks you have plenty of money
and are unsophisticated, and if he has previously had it in his mind
that one dollar would make it right with him, when he hears you make
that remark, he directly decides to charge two dollars. When our
goods were finally removed from Mr. Morse's barn, we asked him what
we owed him.</P>

<P>He looked reflectively off at the ocean in the direction of Cape
Ann. I have noticed that all the men who live permanently on this
shore have this same appearance of possessing reflective powers. That
it is only an appearance I am convinced, for to reflect in reality
one must first have a mind ; and the masculine mind hereabouts seems
to have been nearly all absorbed in a dull planning as to how a
living can be got without working. A certain sharpening of intellects
has taken place since there has been somewhat of an influx of summer
visitors, - not as regards work, but as regards what is popularly
known as ''skinning the visitors.'' The skinning goes through
everything, from the price of a lobster or a dozen perch to rowing
you for an hour in a leaky boat, wherein you have to sit with your
skirts tucked up tightly about your ankles, -if you are so
unfortunate as to be a woman and wear skirts, -and where you are not
unfrequently asked ''to jest take that dipper and bail her out a
little, won't ye?'' You gladly bail her out, because you don't want
to sit with your feet several inches deep in salt water. But when you
land, scrambling out as best you can on the shallow beach, and try to
make it right with your boatman, you do feel as if you had not had
your money's worth. It was experiences like these which led us to set
up a boat on Salt Pond, a sheet of water which lay back of the beach
where we were, between our beach and the main-land.</P>

<P>But I must not anticipate my story, and set up a boat before we
have set up our tent.</P>

<P>When Mr. Morse had contemplated the blue line of the North Shore
for a sufficient length of time, after my question as to my
indebtedness, he said that he guessed he should charge about
seventy-five cents for storage, and he guessed that the damage to his
peace of mind by havin' that dorg a keepin' of him on tenter-hooks in
the way he had would be figgered at about a dollar and a half; and he
would n't have no dorg that would grin in that way in his barn agin
for twice that money. 'T wa'n't no object.</P>

<P>I knew exactly how our big mastiff Max would' as Mr. Morse
graphically expressed it, sit on his tail and grin at any one whom he
thought had intrusive intentions. I would be willing to pay a good
many more dollars rather than that Max should give up that expression
of countenance when he deemed that he had occasion to use it.</P>

<P>This settlement with Mr. Morse was effected after we had reached
the barn, and Max, growing amiable, had consented, at my request, to
the owner's entrance. I implored Mr. Morse to think of some one who
would pitch our tent for us; I entreated him to do it himself, and go
after his hay to-morrow. No; he was immovable. He said that kind of
"ma'sh hay was a kind he'd ben wantin' too long to resk rosin' it
now."</P>

<P>He actually hurried to get away from my importunities. He whipped
his old horse down the hill, and at the foot of it he pulled up, and
shouted back for me "to git Miss Yates to go over the pond and fetch
a man from the road."</P>

<P>We were fast learning that Maria Jane was the only person with a
particle of energy. When I returned to the Yates house I discovered
that Maria had been down to Marsh's dory, and found that he had
brought in three lobsters from the pots the night before, but had not
conveyed them any farther. They had twisted about all night, had
locked themselves firmly and viciously together, and were at present
a string of lobster mixed with rope, which Maria plunged into the big
kettle, under which a fire was now burning.</P>

<P>''I guess that'll unclinch um,'' she said, and added, ''You c'n
have fresh b'iled lobster for breakfast."</P>

<P>We all breakfasted much as we had supped. Marsh had gone out
perching with a neighbor. He had left word for us that we must n't
worry; he guessed he should be back plenty of time to see about that
tent. When I heard that I felt hysterical. It seemed to me hysterics
were justifiable, if not useful. Maria Jane raised herself from her
lobster boiler, put her hands on her hips and looked so full of
energy that Carlos and I revived by merely gazing at her.</P>

<P>''Of course yo' don't take no stock in Marsh's comin' back to do
anything, do ye?"</P>

<P>No, we did not.</P>

<P>''I'll tell ye what I'll do,'' she said briskly: ''ef you'll help
me haul the dory across, I'll go over to the road, and if I don't git
a man my name ain't Maria Jane Yates!''</P>

<P>She was like a general inspiring fainting soldiers. We three went
down to the dory. Its small anchor was stuck into the sand to hold
it. She flung the anchor in, and then pulled by the rope, while we
pushed from behind. It is not enjoyable to do this kind of work,
particularly when you step into petticoats often and the ridge is
very steep. I had no idea a dory could be so heavy. The strip of land
which lies between the sea and the pond is at this place perhaps an
eighth of a mile wide. Just at the most difficult part, as we were
toiling and straining our utmost' I heard a voice behind us
say,--</P>

<P>''I do declare, that ain't women's work!''</P>

<P>It was Cap'n Asel. He had had his breakfast long ago,--it must be
now as late as half past five, -and was out to see if he could pick
up any news.</P>

<P>''If 't was men's work I s'pose they 'd do it,'' said Maria Jane.
With one great heave we got the boat over the ridge, and after that
it was comparatively easy work. In ten minutes more Mrs. Yates was
standing upright in the dory, and sculling swiftly over the smooth
pond.</P>

<P>Cap'n Asel lingered near us, supporting himself comfortably on his
crutches He was very amiable indeed, but when he wondered in a musing
way where Marsh's wife was going and what for, we did not reply. He
did find out where we passed the night, for he asked point blank. He
said ''he did n't know as the Yateses was fixed so 's they could
'commodate lodgers. No bedstids, ye know, nor nuthin', fur's he
knew."</P>

<P>Then he winked again, as he had done when I first saw him. His
winks had a dreadful, paralyzing effect upon me, for the reason, I
think, that of all the faces I have ever seen, his face looked the
most unlikely to wink. It was as utterly confounding as if the mummy
of one of the Pharaohs had done such a thing. I was afraid it would
be our lot to see Cap'n Asel a good deal. I early made the resolution
that I would not gratify his curiosity in the slightest degree. There
are some people who, the moment they ask you a question, inspire you
with a strong desire not to answer it. Cap'n Asel had this effect
upon me. I would not have told him even what I thought concerning the
weather. His sole occupation was to hobble about the shore and find
out every item about everybody. I did not, until I knew him, fully
understand what the word "inquisitive" means.</P>

<P>I was sure by his manner--one could tell nothing by his face--that
he meant to stay with us until Mrs. Yates came back, so that he might
possibly learn why she had gone across Salt Pond.</P>
