<CENTER><B>THE DECORATIVE ARTS.</B></CENTER>

<P>Hereafter I hope in another lecture to have the pleasure of laying
before you an historical survey of the Decorative Arts, and I must
confess it would have been pleasanter to me to have begun my talk
with you by entering at once upon the subject of the history of this
great industry; but, as I have something to say in a third lecture
about various matters connected with the practice of Decoration among
ourselves in these days, I feel that I should be in a false position
before you, and one that might lead to confusion, or overmuch
explanation, if I did not let you know what I think on the nature and
scope of these arts, on their condition at the present time, and
their outlook in times to come. In doing this it is like enough that
I shall say things with which you will very much disagree; I must ask
you therefore from the outset to believe that, whatever I may blame,
or whatever I may praise, I neither, when I think of what history has
been, am inclined to lament the past, to despise the present, or
despair of the future; that I believe all the change and stir about
us is a sign of the world's life, and that it will lead - by ways,
indeed, of which we have no guess - to the bettering of all
mankind.</P>

<P>Now as to the scope and nature of these Decorative Arts I have to
say, that though when I come more into the details of my subject I
shall not meddle much with the great art of Architecture, and less
still with the great arts commonly called Sculpture and Painting, yet
I cannot in my own mind quite sever them from those lesser, so-called
Decorative Arts, which I have to speak about: it is only in latter
times, and under the most intricate conditions of life, that they
have fallen apart from one another; and I hold that, when they are so
parted, it is ill for the Arts altogether: the lesser ones become
trivial, mechanical, unintelligent, incapable of resisting the
changes pressed upon them by fashion or dishonesty; while the
greater, however they may be practised for a while by men of great
minds and wonder-working hands, unhelped by the lesser, unhelped by
each other, are sure to lose their dignity of popular arts, and
become nothing but dull adjuncts to unmeaning pomp, or ingenious toys
for a few rich and idle men.</P>

<P>However, I have not undertaken to talk to you of Architecture,
Sculpture, and Painting, in the narrower sense of those words, since,
most unhappily as I think, these master-arts, these arts more
specially of the intellect, are at the present day divorced from
decoration in its narrower sense. Our subject is that great body of
art, by means of which men have at all times more or less striven to
beautify the familiar matters of everyday life: a wide subject, a
great industry; but a great part of the history of the world, and a
most instrument to the study of that history.</P>

<P>A very great industry indeed, comprising the trades of
house-building, painting, joinery and carpentry, smiths' work,
pottery and glass-making, weaving, and many others: a body of art
most important to the public in general, but still more so to us
handicraftsmen; since there is scarce anything that they use, and
that we fashion, but it has always been thought to be unfinished till
it has had some touch or other of decoration about it. True it is,
that in many or most cases we have got so used to this ornament, that
we look upon it as if it had grown of itself, and note it no more
than the mosses on the dry sticks with which we light our files. So
much the worse! for there is the decoration, or some pretence of it,
and it has, or ought to have, a use and a meaning. For, and this is
at the root of the whole matter, everything made by man's hands has a
form, which must be either beautiful or ugly; beautiful if it is in
accord with Nature, and helps her; ugly if it is discordant with
Nature, and thwarts her; it cannot be indifferent; we, for our parts
are busy or sluggish, eager or unhappy, and our eyes are apt to get
dulled to this eventfulness of form in those things which we are
always looking at. Now it is one of the chief uses of decoration, the
chief part of its alliance with nature, that it has to sharpen our
dulled senses in this matter: for this end are those wonders of
intricate patterns interwoven, those strange forms invented, that men
have so long delighted in: forms and intricacies that do not
necessarily imitate nature, but in which the hand of the craftsman is
guided to work in the way that she does, till the web, the cup, or
the knife, look as natural, nay as lovely, as the green field, the
river bank, or the mountain flint.</P>

<P>To give people pleasure in the things they must perforce use, that
is one great office of decoration; to give people pleasure in the
things they must perforce make, that is the other use of it.</P>

<P>Does not our subject look important enough now? I say that without
these arts, our rest would be vacant and uninteresting, our labour
mere endurance, mere wearing away of body and mind.</P>

<P>As for that last use of these arts, the giving us pleasure in our
work, I scarcely know how to speak strongly enough of it; and yet if
I did not know the value of repeating a truth again and again, I
should have to excuse myself to you for saying any more about this,
when I remember how a great man now living has spoken of it: I mean
my friend Professor John Ruskin: if you read the chapter in the 2nd
vol. of his Stones of Venice entitled, `On the Nature of Gothic, and
the Office of the Workman therein,' you will read at once the truest
and the most eloquent words that can possibly be said on the subject.
What I have to say upon it can scarcely be more than an echo of his
words, yet I repeat there is some use in reiterating a truth, lest it
be forgotten; so I will say this much further; we all know what
people have said about the curse of labour, and what heavy and
grievous nonsense are the more part of their words thereupon; whereas
indeed the real curses of craftsmen have been the curse of stupidity,
and the curse of injustice from within and from without: no, I cannot
suppose there is anybody here who would think it either a good life,
or an amusing one, to sit with one's hands before one doing nothing -
to live like a gentleman, as fools call it.</P>

<P>Nevertheless there is dull work to be done, and a weary business
it is setting men about such work, and seeing them through it, and I
would rather do the work twice over with my own hands than have such
a job: but now only let the arts we are talking of ornament our
labour, and be widely spread, intelligent, well understood both by
the maker and the user, let them grow in one word popular, and there
will be pretty much an end of dull work and its wearing slavery; and
no man will an longer have an excuse for talking about the curse of
labour, no man will any longer have an excuse for evading the
blessing of labour. I believe there is nothing that will aid the
world's progress so much as the attainment of this; I protest there
is nothing in the world that I desire so much as this, wrapped up, as
I am sure it is, with changes political and social, that in one way
or another we all desire.</P>

<P>Now if the objection be made, that these arts have been the
handmaids of luxury, of tyranny, and of superstition, I must needs
say that it is true in a sense; they have been so used, as many other
excellent things have been. It is also true that, among some nations,
their most vigorous and freest times have been the very blossoming
times of art; while at the same time, I must allow that these
decorative arts have flourished among oppressed peoples, who have
seemed to have no hope of freedom; yet I do not think that we shall
be wrong in thinking that at such times, among such peoples, art at
least was free; when it has not been, when it has really been gripped
by superstition, by luxury, it has straightway begun to sicken under
that grip. Nor must you forget that when men say popes, kings, and
emperors built such and such buildings, it is a mere way of speaking.
You look in your history-books to see who built Westminster Abbey,
who built St. Sophia at Constantinople, and they tell you Henry III.,
Justinian the Emperor. Did they? or, rather, men like you and me,
handicraftsmen, who have left no names behind them, nothing but their
work?</P>
