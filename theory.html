<BLOCKQUOTE>The widest use of pattern-designing is the clothing of
   the walls of a room.... Doubtless there will be some, in these
   days at least, who will say, "Tis most helpful to me to let the
   bare walls alone." So also there would be some who, when asked
   with what manner of books they will furnish their room, would
   answer, "With none." But I think you will agree with me in
   thinking that both these sets of people would be in an unhealthy
   state of mind, and probably of body also; in which case we need
   not trouble ourselves about their whims, since it is with healthy
   &amp; sane people only that art has dealings.

<P>Late nineteenth century writers on the decorative arts set out to
educate industrial designers and the public on their theories of
design reform. English theorists of the 1870's were soon followed by
American critics offering a prolific number of lectures and books on
the subject during the 1880's and 1890's. Their influence reached
from the highest levels of society to the masses as ideas originally
presented to cultured readers were quickly copied by authors of books
of wider distribution. The aim of the reformers was to transform the
decorative arts and to change public taste in interior design.</P>

<H4><CENTER>WALLPAPER IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERIOR DESIGN</CENTER></H4>

<P>During the past decade of the Victorian Revival, considerable
attention has been paid to the reproduction of authentic period
wallpaper patterns for use in restoration design. Manufacturers have
offered the most elaborate examples and combinations of 19th century
wallpapers as a model for modern consumers, who are encouraged to
choose from a profuse display of color and pattern, lest they feel
that their decorating might not measure up to true period standards.
However, when reading the words of late nineteenth century design
critics, one finds that even the most ardent advocates of art
wallpapers suggested moderation in the employment of these pattern
designs. According to late Victorian writers, the highest style of
decorating was not measured by the quantity of patterns employed, but
by the discreet layering of wallpaper, paint, furnishing textiles and
carpet chosen to create a harmonious ensemble. No single element was
to be considered alone; interior decorating did not exist solely of
wallpaper, or carpet, or fabric, but it was an artistic unity of
design that was the goal. Having said this, it should be noted that
wallpaper was a matter of special attention to these writers, as it
formed an omnipresent surface covering at the time. Then as now,
wallpaper forms the backdrop for all other furnishings.</P>

<P>Books on interior design were widely read and the formulas given
by decorative arts critics for selecting room colors and wallpapers
were followed so faithfully that one later critic, Elsie de Wolfe,
mocked clients who did not exercise their own judgment and or stop to
consider the overall effect of their wallpaper selections on the
interior design of their house.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Who doesn't know the woman who... selects a "rich" paper
   for her hall and an "elegant" paper for her drawing-room - the
   chances are it is a nile green moir&eacute; paper! For her library
   she thinks a paper imitating an Oriental fabric is the proper
   thing, and as likely as not she buys gold paper for her
   dining-room. She finds so many charming bedroom papers that she
   has no trouble in selecting a dozen of them for insipid blue rooms
   and pink rooms and lilac rooms.... She decides to use a red paper
   of large figures in one room, and a green paper with snaky stripes
   in the adjoining room, but she doesn't try the papers out; she
   doesn't give them the fair test of living with them a few days....
   You should assemble all the papers that are to be used in the
   house, and all the fabrics, and rugs, and see what the effect of
   the various compositions will be, one with another.

<H4><CENTER>NINETEENTH CENTURY DESIGN REFORM</CENTER></H4>

<P>The first stage of the English design reform movement in the
1850's was an orchestrated national effort to develop a style of
decorative arts different from the French style which dominated at
the time, in which wallpapers, carpets and all manner of the
decorative arts were ornamented with highly naturalistic depiction of
flora. Seeds of the reform movement are found in the Gothic Revival,
with which designers advocated moral principles of "truth" and
"honesty" in use of materials and decoration. Beginning in the late
1850's in England and in the 1870's in America, principles of reform
movement design were taught in newly founded industrial arts schools,
and a near science was made of the new approach to decorative
design.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>As a principle, it will be found that the value of the
   manufactured article is dependent upon the <I>knowledge</I>
   displayed in the using and adorning the material, and not upon the
   amount of labour expended upon its construction. The same clay can
   be wrought into a thing of beauty or an object without comeliness,
   and the most welcome ornaments are usually both simple in
   character and sparingly used, for extravagance in ornament is as
   offensive as extravagance in dress.
   
   <P>Dr. Christopher Dresser,<I> The Art of Decorative Design</I>,
   London: Day and Son, 1862, pp. 20 - 21.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Two basic principles of reform movement design can be quickly
summed up as follows:</P>

<P><B>1. Design should be honest to the function of the object and
the nature of the material. With respect to wallpaper, because the
material is intended for use on flat, two dimensional wall planes,
the ornament printed on wallpaper should have a flattened appearance
and never look rounded or present a trompe l'oeil simulation of
stone, carved plaster or wood.</B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P><B>2. Patterns of flora should present a "conventionalized"
depiction of foliage and flowers, abstracted to represent the
structure and growth pattern of the plant. In place of bouquets of
flowers, botanical arrangements of the stems, leaves and flowers were
shown abstractly.</B></P>

<P>Once theorists had been successful at introducing these basic
design principles to industrial and pattern designers, and they were
quickly put into practice by manufacturers, attention shifted to
publishing treatises instructing the public on the suitable use of
pattern.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The first consideration, upon taking possession of new
   quarters, is the paper-hanging. From Dr. Dresser's "Principles of
   Design," we cull this bit of wisdom. "All walls, however
   decorated, should serve as a back-ground to whatever stands in
   front of them.... Those sent from well-known manufacturers in
   England are marked by refined tones of color laid flat upon
   conventionalized designs, and by the sparing introduction of dull
   gold into the back-ground. Those of Dresser and of Morris, are
   familiar in our houses.... American taste, hitherto inclining
   toward heavy color and intense gilding, as still seen in some
   restaurants and concert-halls, has during the last two years taken
   a long stride forward in the matter of paperings.
   
   <P>Constance Cary Harrison, <I>Woman's Handiwork in Modern Homes,
   </I>New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1881, p. 136.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Harrison and contemporary design critics advised the public on how
to select patterns and colorings for different rooms of the house and
for different situations of lighting. William Morris, the most famous
wallpaper designer and theorist of the nineteenth century, made
suggestions for American consumers on how to use his papers in a
pamphlet published for distribution at an international trade exhibit
in Boston in 1883.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Pattern-choosing, like pattern-making, is an
   Architectural Art.... Do not be afraid of choosing a large one. If
   the light in the room be bright and plentiful, choose from the
   fainter colorings. If the light be weak, choose patterns of strong
   relief.... The walls &amp; woodwork have generally the
   predominating color, and the carpet is secondary.
   
   <P>William Morris, The Morris Exhibit at the Foreign Fair, Boston,
   1883-84, Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1883, pp. 19 - 20.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Suggestions were given by other authors for choosing papers to
compliment the view of the landscape seen from the room, and with a
consideration to how the colors would look under the artificial
lighting.</P>

<P>After the 1870's, when elaborate art wallpaper sets were first
introduced, English and American design critics changed their views
concerning the acceptability of layering wallpapers and borders on
walls and ceilings. American architect Henry Hudson Holly reflected
the latest fashion in the late 1870's when he wrote that:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The breaking up of wall surface with frieze and dado is
   one of the peculiar characteristics of the English designs, and in
   this way some of the best combinations of color and pattern are
   produced.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Regarding the decoration of ceilings, he also recommended:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It may not be inappropriate to introduce around the
   ceiling a margin of some tasteful design in wall-paper... The
   remainder of the ceiling, if low, should be of some tint
   calculated to give and appearance of elevation, such as, for
   instance, one of the many delicate shades of blue or violet. If,
   however, there be sufficient height to warrant it, a rose tint, or
   buff, appears well, providing the general tone of the room will
   permit.
   
   <P>Henry Hudson Holly, <I>Modern Dwellings</I>, New York: Harper
   &amp; Brothers, 1878, p. 163 and p. 166.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A contemporary English interior designer, Aldam Heaton, offered an
alternative.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is quite possible that a plain, or nearly plain wall,
   with a dado and frieze, more or less ornamental, might have been
   far better than any sort of pattern. Our rooms often get terribly
   over-patterned - patterned wall and ceiling, patterned floor,
   patterned curtains, patterned furniture-covers; where are we to
   get a little rest for the eye if not occasionally by a plain wall?
   
   <P>Aldam Heaton, <I>Beauty and Art</I>, New York: D. Appleton
   &amp; Co., 1897, p. 108.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>William Morris emphatically disagreed with the contemporary
English design practice of multi-patterned walls and he recommended
hanging wallpapers without borders.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Never stoop to the ignominy of a paper dado; at a fancy
   fair, or some temporary thing, where effect without solidity may
   be excused, mere scene-painting is allowable, - but scarcely at
   home.
   
   <P>William Morris, The Morris Exhibit at the Foreign Fair, Boston,
   1883-84, Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1883, p. 16.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>William Morris also disapproved of wallpaper friezes, and he
advocated painted ceilings instead of the elaborate borders and
ceiling papers that were a fad of the late 1870's.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It will be understood from this that Morris &amp; Company
   do not print distinctive frieze-patterns. One of the simplest
   yellow and white, or white-ground wallpapers, is sometimes used
   for the frieze, when tone requires some faint patterning... but in
   this case the pattern is altogether subordinate to the tone, and
   its color is the chief value.... The decoration of a frieze, if it
   &#91;have&#93; any pretension at all, should be done by hand....
   Ceiling-papers we seldom use.... Not that painting of ceilings
   should be discouraged, but purposeless array of varied tints, the
   drawing of meaningless lines of color, would be better
   discontinued.
   
   <P>William Morris, The Morris Exhibit at the Foreign Fair, Boston,
   1883-84, Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1883, pp. 17 - 18.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The editors of <I>Art &amp; Decoration</I> magazine, published in
New York, echoed this in 1885:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>As a rule it is well not to overload the wall or ceiling
   of a private house with ornaments, but to keep to broad fields of
   color artistically mottled, shaded or textured. Ornaments, indeed,
   may and should be used in the frieze and upon the ceiling, but
   sparingly and with great care as to harmony of color and design.
   Elaborate ornamentation may be admissible in theatres and other
   public buildings, but in the decoration of a house everything
   should be of a restful nature.
   
   <P>George Halm publisher and Caryl Coleman editor, <I>Art &amp;
   Decoration, </I>Vol. 1, No. 1, New York, p. 11.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>American domestic architecture of the 1880's and 1890's,
particularly homes with Old Colony Style interiors featuring colonial
details and low-studded walls that are found in many Queen Anne,
Shingle Style and Colonial Revival houses, are best suited to the
sparing use of ceiling ornamentation as advocated in <I>Art &amp;
Decoration</I>, and to Morris's ideas of employing beautiful patterns
on walls without the complication of ceiling, frieze or dado papers.
Morris rejected the heavy embellishment of High Victorian paper and
stencil decorations, and he influenced the later generation of Arts
&amp; Crafts designers. By the 1890's, American wallpaper
manufacturers simplified their offerings to coordinated sets of wall,
frieze and ceiling papers without additional borders or
embellishments, that appealed to the mass market, but which still met
with disapproval from critics. The movement away from the Victorian
multi-patterned wall is summed up by Elsie de Wolfe.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A fine frieze is a very beautiful decoration, but it must
   be very fine to be worth while at all.... It goes without saying
   that those dreadful friezes perpetrated by certain wall paper
   designers are very bad form, and should never be used. Indeed, the
   very principle of the ordinary paper frieze is bad; it darkens the
   upper wall unpleasantly, and violates the good old rule that the
   floors should be darkest in tone, the side walls lighter, and the
   ceiling lightest.
   
   <P>Elsie de Wolfe, The House in Good Taste, New York: The Century
   Co., 1914, pp. 55 - 56.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Homeowners today should not be encouraged to force a packaged
design selection onto a room for which it is not well suited (such as
hanging elaborate ceiling decorations in rooms lower than 10 feet in
height). In some houses, dado papers are appropriate for hallways and
dining rooms, and friezes and ceiling papers are recommended if
ceiling heights permit, but for many homes built after 1880,
especially in rooms for which Arts &amp; Crafts Movement designs are
selected, all that is needed are solo wallpapers. For the homeowner,
interior designer and paperhanger today, it is important to
appreciate the various design solutions advocated in the past, and to
determine which is the best use of wallpaper to suit the unique
proportions and architectural detailing of the room.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>... let customers once become familiar with the sight of
   good forms and judicious combinations of colour, and we may one
   day aspire to the formation of a national taste.
   
   <P>Charles Eastlake, Hints on Household Taste, London: Longmans,
   Green &amp; Co., 1878, pp. 118-119.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
