<P>There are two points in which our house-painters fail when such a
task is given them. The chief is, the enjoyment of color. This comes
partly from inherited deficiency, and partly from a long education
received at their clients' hands, the public enjoying color just as
little as the painters themselves. We have insisted so long on
covering our great stretches of wall with pale tints - fawns,
pearl-grays, ashes-of-roses, apple-greens, with the woodwork to
match, that the painters' pattern-books contain nothing else, or did
not until lately. And, again, we have so insisted on neatness and
precision, that all freedom and spontaneity have been educated out of
these workmen. Now, nothing is more characteristic of the best
decorative art everywhere - I mean on what may be called its mechanic
side - than the freedom with which obedience to the laws of design is
paid. We have had our notions of the necessity of formality and
symmetry effectually disturbed by the study of Japanese art, but the
best art of any people, Greek, Roman, Italian, would have taught us
the same lesson. If we had studied the laws of design as revealed by
the best examples, we should not be so put about when we see a line
left by the painter, which, though all right as far as horizontal or
perpendicular are concerned, is a hair's breadth thicker than it was
a few inches before, or a wee bit more loaded with paint at one point
than at another; nor would it worry us that these stencilled patterns
with which the painter has diapered our walls, though true in the
main, are still not absolutely obedient to the square of the drill
sergeant. One of the open secrets of nature's design is this variety
in uniformity, this symmetry produced by balance and not be
repetition. the spots upon a leopard's skin, the stripes upon the
tiger, seem, to the careless view, regularly disposed, corresponding
in number and direction, but it needs only a slight amount of
observation to discover that the stars in the sky or the daisies in
the meadow are not more freely sown than are these painted spots and
streaks on the leopard and the tiger.</P>

<P>But, this freedom, and apparent, if not real, spontaneity of
design are not possible to such house-painters as we have, even
though their skill in other directions, in the smooth laying-on of
color and the matching of tints, be nearly perfect, as it certainly
is with the best of them. Even if they were capable of coloring the
walls of our houses as harmoniously as the old Pompeians knew how to
do, there is another reason, a housekeeper's reason, this time, and
not an artistic one, that I think would prevent the universal use of
fresco-painting as a means of decorating our walls. This may be
simply stated. Our modern mode of living, the necessities of heating
and lighting our rooms, since we live almost constantly indoors
during the coldest and darkest months of the year, together with
other causes, make it necessary for us to clean the walls, ceilings
and floors of our houses at least once a year; and while this is done
by almost everybody in the Spring, careful housekeepers repeat the
cleaning in the Autumn. now, walls colored in distemper (for real
fresco - the color applied when the plaster is fresh and absorbent -
is never practiced among us) cannot be effectually cleaned, but have
to be handled with a good deal of care. And as the first cost of
painting in distemper that should be done with any approach to
artistic skill, would be considerable, its renewal would only be
risked by those to whom expense is of little moment. Practically,
therefore, we have been driven in our search for a mode of decoration
that should meet all our modern conditions, to the use of wall-paper.
For, oil-painting is, now-a-days, only to be thought of when
bed-rooms, or small, seldom-used, rooms are under consideration. The
expense of carrying out any sustained system of wall-decoration in
oil-colors would be too great in the first place and nothing would be
gained by it, for, no matter how well done, the artistic effect could
never be so pleasing as that produced either by distemper or by
wall-paper.</P>

<P>The first practical advantages of wall-paper are, the ease with
which it is applied, and the ease with which it is renewed. With our
American migratory habits, and love of getting out of one house into
another, it is a great recommendation that our new dwelling can be
made to change its coat as a snake does his skin, and with new papers
on the walls, and fresh paint on the wood-work, be made all sweet and
clean from garret to basement. Beside, tastes change from year to
year; and, moreover, what pleases one, does not please another, We
take possession of a new house, and wonder how our predecessor could
have had the bad taste to select such papers for his walls, or how he
came to submit to them, if the bad taste displayed in them proves to
have been his predecessor's , and not his. In either case we make
haste to strip them off the walls that are to be ours, and to put on
others of our own selection, which perhaps will be wondered at in
their turn by those who shall take the house when we have done with
it.</P>

<P>We are told that wall-paper was first used in Europe as a
substitute for the tapestry so commonly employed in the middle ages,
partly as a protection against the cold and damp of the stone walls
of the houses, partly, no doubt, as an ornament. As to its origin, it
may have been one of the many inventions borrowed from the East, and
I dare say might be traced, like the introduction of porcelain, to
the Dutch trade with China and Japan. The Japanese make great use of
paper - with paper and the bamboo they contrive to fill out one-half
the catalogue of the necessities of life, clay and wood serving for
the other half. But the use they make of paper in the construction of
their houses is singular. The walls are lined with this material, and
the divisions between the rooms are made largely, if not entirely, by
means of screens covered with paper as a rule, though, in some cases,
silk is employed. Judging from the few hundreds of specimens I have
seen, and from what I have been told, the Japanese wall-paper does
not come in rolls like ours, but in pieces a little longer than they
are broad, and of different sizes: the largest of those that I have
examined are three feet long by fifteen inches wide, but the greater
part are only fifteen inches long by twelve wide - the longer line
being the horizontal. Now, what makes it seem probable that our first
European notion of wallpapers come from Japan, it is the fact that
the first papers made in Holland and thence introduced into England
and France were printed in these small sizes, nor was it until some
time in the last century, that the present mode of making long rolls
was adopted. I have seen, in old houses on Long Island, walls covered
with these small squares of paper. These early wall-papers were
handprinted from blocks, and were only one of the many modifications
and adaptations of the block-printing which gave us our first books
and our first wood-cuts. The next application of the invention was to
stuffs, which were printed by hand from blocks, in the same way.</P>

<P>The printing of papers for covering walls is said to have been
introduced into Spain and Holland about the middle of the sixteenth
century. And I have read, somewhere, that this mode of printing the
patterns on small pieces of paper was an imitation of the Spanish
squares of stamped and painted leather with which the grandees of
Spain covered their walls - a fashion that spread all over Europe. It
must be remembered, however, that in the sixteenth century, Spain and
Holland were most intimately connected, and there was such a constant
give and take between them, so far as arts and manufactures were
concerned, that it would be hard to decide such a question as this
with certainty. It is even possible the Japanese themselves may have
borrowed the first notion of printing their wall-papers in the manner
they did, from a former custom of using leather; at any rate, many of
their wall-papers imitate stamped leather in texture and pattern, and
even in smell, and are not easily distinguishable from it. Still, I
incline to believe that the matters are not to be confounded, but
that the Spanish, with whom cattle abounded, so that the leather was
cheap, and with whom the manufacture of leather into articles of use
and ornament was carried to a high degree of perfection, used leather
for their walls because, as they treated it - stamping it with rich
patterns, painting it and gilding it - they obtained rich and
sumptuous effects in interior decoration, and also because it was the
material which most naturally suggested itself for the purpose. The
sizes of the pieces employed were such as were most naturally and
economically cut from the skins, and it is possible that these skins,
so stamped and ornamented, may have been introduced into Japan by the
Dutch, and imitated by that very imitative people. It seems to me
more natural to conclude the making of wall-papers by the Dutch an
attempt to imitate what their traders had seen in Japan, and, yet, it
may also be that the size and shape of the first Dutch wall-papers
were not copied from the Japanese originals at all, but adopted
solely from convenience of printing.</P>

<P>I presume it would add considerably to the labor of covering walls
with paper, if it were attempted to revive the old fashion of using
sheets, and there might be practical difficulties in the way of
keeping the papers neat, and their edges unfrayed while on the
dealers shelves, but something would be gained in the look of the
wall when the paper was laid; the surface would be agreeably varied,
not mearly by the more frequent joints, but by differences in the
tints of the squares, since it would be almost impossible to produce
an absolute uniformity. Something at any rate would be done toward
breaking up the monotony which troubles us in the modern perfection
of the wall-paper manufacture, and in disturbing the impeccable
evenness with which the best hands contrive to lay the long breadths
upon the smooth walls.</P>

<P>In the growth of good taste in the community, this monotony has
begun to trouble many of us, and attention has been directed to the
best way of preventing it. I was speaking some little while ago of
the difficulty we encounter in the attempt to get artistic work done
easily and cheaply, and there is no reason that cannot be overcome,
why it should not be common and cheap. But, an obstacle in the way,
not easily surmounted, is found in our American love of neatness and
precision, qualities of undeniable excellence, and desirable in
housekeeping and in business, but which have no place in the
decorative arts, other than in a general way. Our own insistance on
this neatness and precision, coupled with the want of artistic
feeling in our mechanics, have tended strongly to throw us on
mechanical methods, the result being a cheap and characterless
decoration, of which we tire almost as soon as it is set before us.
And if we try to escape from this kind of work, and seek the same
neatness and finish at the hands of the few trained workmen we have,
we find the expense out of all proportion to the result. Even the
monotony of wall-paper as it used to be applied, and as it is still
applied in the majority of our houses, outside the cities at least,
was an advance, and an important one, on the monotony of blank
whitness that was once the fashion everywhere. Certainly, ten years
ago we Americans had a mania for whiteness in our houses, inside and
outside! I remember to have been much amused when crossing the
Atlantic on the return voyage by an enthusiastic countryman who
chanted in unflinching tones the praise of white walls. He said, he
had seen every one of the famous buildings in Europe, and not one of
them could compare with the Capitol at Washington - it was so white
and clean. He was also strong in his expression of disapproval of the
universal practice in Europe of coloring the interior walls of the
houses. "Why, sir," said he, "over there, as soon as the walls are
plastered, or as soon as they are dry, the people either paint them
or cover them with wall-paper! Now you know that we Americans think
the white plaster most beautiful to look at, and we never think of
painting it or papering it until it has begun to look soiled."</P>

<P>There was, no doubt, much truth in this gentleman's statement at
the time, ten years ago, when he made it, though even then, the
change had begun to set in to the practice which is now almost
universal. But, there were different reasons for the love of
whiteness in different parts of the country. In Philadelphia, where
it still largely survives, there was the Quaker love of neatness and
simplicity, the distaste for bright colors which, though not a part
of the original inheritance of the Friends, had become identified
with their creed in the popular fancy. We have to remember that the
introduction of plastered walls had been hailed in England in James
the First's time, as one of the greatest of modern improvements, and
for a long time it superseded every other method of covering ceilings
and walls, and the pleasure taken in it continued for a long time in
England, and was naturally transplanted to her American colonies. In
New England I suspect it was neither fashion nor any particular
liking for bare white walls, that kept the "hard-finish" so long in
popularity, but simply poverty, and the disposition to let ornaments
go, and throw all the small overplus of money there might be after
the necessities of life were gained, into the fund that should supply
the solid comforts of life or the education that was there held to be
no less an imperative need than bread-and-butter.</P>
