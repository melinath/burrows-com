        <font size="4"><strong>Burrows &amp; Co. offers authentic woven carpets by William Morris, the most famous 19<sup>th</sup> century English designer, and founder of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement.� These were popular in England and America in the 19th and early 20th century. � Morris designs are equally at home in Queen Anne, Shingle Style and Colonial Revival homes as in Arts &amp; Crafts homes and bungalows. Morris "Tulip &amp; Lily" design is the only carpet pattern from the 19th century that has been kept in continual production.� Our other Morris patterns have been reproduced from antique samples and design documents in the mill archive. Our carpets are woven in England by the same firm that originally made Morris carpets.</strong></font>

                    <p><strong>Morris also designed carpets in a flat weave known in England as "Kidderminster" and in America as "Ingrain."� Burrows &amp; Company has collaborated with Family Heir-Loom Weavers, for reproducing "Vine &amp; Pomegranate" and "Daisy" (also known as "Grass").� The latter is he original runner used at Kelmscott Manor.�</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Both are available directly from Family Heir-Loom Weavers in Red Lion, Pennsylvania.</strong></p>

                    In the closing of the 1883 catalog of an exhibit of Morris' work it was necessary to warn customers from bootlegged copies of his work.  "We sell only to [those tradesmen], and no others can supply the goods we make. This statement is the more necessary, as we know that unauthorized copies and various imitations are offered for sale, without explanation."� The Morris carpets offered by J.R. Burrows &amp; Company come from the original weavers and are the only authentic Morris Wilton, Brussels and Axminster carpets available today.</strong></p>
