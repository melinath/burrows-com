<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>"He that has two cakes of bread, let him sell
      one of them for some flower of the narcissus; for bread is the
      food of the body; but narcissus is food for the soul."-MAHOMET.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>No need now for such sacrifice of one lawful appetite to another;
streets and shops vie with one another in many-coloured abundance of
spring blooms; they blossom like the rose, and there seems something
almost of the miraculous in the exchange of a few dingy copper coins
for so great a treasure of fragrance and freshness, something nearly
akin to the strange bargaining in fairy-tales and the "Arabian
Nights." But what soul could profitably feed on flowers of the
narcissus, nervelessly stuffed into the self-same vessel with a bunch
of gilliflowers and anemones, or other equally unsympathetic
neighbours. It is, indeed, strange that so large a proportion of
those who entertain an honest affection for flowers-who, had they
only the prophet's proverbial two cakes of bread, would assuredly
sell one of them for some flower of the narcissus-still are given to
treat them so unhandsomely in the matter of arrangement. You are led
to wonder what manner of pleasure may be theirs in the blossoms they
so innocently maltreat, whose charms they so successfully obscure;
but as even the most devoid of aesthetic sensibility will far more
readily forgive an aspersion on their morals than upon their taste
(or the lack of it), this interesting problem is likely to remain
unsolved.</P>

<P>It is not, of course, to be expected that a race so generally
careless of and insensitive to, all the less obvious forms of beauty
as ours, should have developed, as have the Japanese, a complete
system and science of floral arrangement, with its own counsels of
perfection, its own definite laws of line and structure, where twig
and leaf, even as bud and blossom, have each their appointed parts to
play in the beautiful scheme. This is an art by itself and a very
complex and intricate accomplishment-yet well worth the mastery-with
the Japanese. Our most felicitous arrangements would show, in
comparison with the least of theirs, as commonplace as might a
Millais beside a Velasquez, a lyric by Thomas Haynes Bailey printed
opposite a sonnet of Shakespeare's.</P>

<P>Here we have not the time, nor, presumably, the inclination, to
study so fair and comely a science. Most of us are every whit as well
pleased by a trite and tasteless effect as by a fine harmony of line
and colour. Flowers are flowers, we say, and everyone knows that a
love for flowers is indicative of a refined and poetic cast of mind;
so we take pink tulips, white lilac, and yellow tulips, and crowd all
together in bowls of water, in as sickly a discord as ever made glad
the heart of woman. Or we make posies of red anemones and daffodils,
with sprays of mimosa gracefully stuck between; or unholy
combinations of blue and pink hyacinths, and so forth, mostly too
numerous both as to quantity and quality.</P>

<P>And it were so very easy, you would think so much easier even, not
to err thus elaborately. Simplicity is in this, at least, facile of
achievement; such a small amount of discrimination is necessary to
perceive what vessels are best suited to the flowers you propose to
set in water. It is naturally better to avoid mingling different
kinds of flowers, unless you are cowered with a very finely-developed
instinct for colour and proportion, which is rare. Three or four
opaque pearl-white tulips, with their tall stems and pale green
leaves, in a slender jar of old Japanese bronze are immeasurably
better than the entire harvest of a hot-house unintelligently
distributed about a room. Half a handful of daffodils amid their
green spears, loosely set in a long, slim, trumpet-shaped glass, very
clear and fine, fulfil their decorative destiny worthily and
well.</P>

<P>The motley, tightly packed nosegay of the past, -more like an
ill-made mosaic than a company of living flowers, - now all but
obsolete, was a marvellous leveller. No single flower was permitted
to enjoy its own individuality; all alike were crushed and ground
down to the same decorative neutrality. But although we do not sin so
uncompromisingly, we are prone to err with more pretension, and it
remains to be proved whether the sheer obtuse brutality of the bygone
method was really so very much more condemnable than the
self-conscious solecisms of the new. To recognize that different
flowers demand different manners of disposal, and different (if any)
companionship, would seem to be one of the most obvious and
elementary necessities; and yet, to be sure, it is often enough
ignored.</P>

<P>Short-stemmed flowers, flowers with no particularly distinctive
silhouette, that look best in clustered masses, are, perhaps, the
least facile to deal with. Shallow blue Nankin bowls make excellent
receptacles for violets and for primroses, as do certain bronzes,
provided they be not too deep. But for plucked crocuses the only
adequate shrine that comes to mind is a graceful Japanese bronze
incense burner, three-legged, and very shallow in the bowl. The cover
is formed of a kind of trellis work of ivy-stalks, berries, and
leaves, through whose liberal interstices the amethyst and white
chalices, with their saffron centres and small striped spears, stand
up triumphantly after the habit of their growth. Some of the bronze
Japanese flower vessels are fitted with bars, so placed across the
mouth as to hold sufficiently upright a bough in blossom. These
cannot, of course, be bought at the ordinary Oriental emporium, but
could, in all likelihood, bet procured from more researched
collections. They are eminently desirable possessions, for by their
means you are enabled to give the character of the growth full play,
and to display to best advantage the gracious curves and outlines of
leaf and stem and petal.- What in early spring could be much more
pictorially pleasing than blossoming boughs of almond or pyrus
japonica, set- always with due regard to their shape and direction-in
one of-these vessels? Then, a little later, there will be plum and
apple-blossom, plucked when the branch is in bud, and breaking day by
day to full flower, on your table, an you will. Later, again, come
glorious opportunities afforded by the iris-purple, or amber, or
freaked, pansy-wise, with both-by certain varieties of lily, of
magnolia, and, last of all, by burnished autumn foliage, silver,
copper, or gold.</P>

<P>The dark rosewood tulip-stands of last century (devised when the
bulbs they were meant to enshrine were worth far more than their
weight in gold), classical cup-shaped urns cut in bars to show a
brass lining, and supported on tall tripods, have mostly been turned
to other uses; they entertain the patient palm and the dreary
aspodistra; which seems a pity, for the old order was pleasing and
appropriate enough. In clear glasses, whether white or green, but
white for preference, tulips are a joy so long as they may last,
unless perchance they open too widely; and in jars of blue and white
Delft, genially globular above and tapering elegantly towards the
base, they are perhaps more attractive still, with a charm of
quaintness peculiarly Dutch. With tulips it is best to keep the
colours separate, more especially with the striped sorts; anemones,
however, are all the better for variety. You may mix deep purple,
dark red, faintest pink, palest lilac, and silver white anemones all
in one group with an effect more richly beautiful than a heap of
gleaming gems or an old stained glass window with the spring sun
shining through. It should be remembered that half the poetry of the
wind-flower is lost by putting too many blossoms into the vase, for
the stalk has (like that of the marsh marigold) a way of growing, as
it were, in the water you have set it in, and taking, in the process,
the most divine curves imaginable. Robust and yet delicate, strong
and radiant with a most joyous and wonderful strength, it seems the
very embodiment of youth and of spring. For lilac, which, like
wisteria, demands to be disposed in masses, and a high vessel, the
classic copper tea urn of the Georgian era is the ideal vase; it is
readily adapted from its former m&eacute;tier, and presently, when
the summer shall come, will show pre-eminently fair, filled with
great white peonies. Wall-flowers, too, are best seen in large
trusses, and for these you can find nothing better than an old copper
wine-cooler.</P>

<P>Blue and white china punch-bowls, when not over deep, provide
sympathetic shrines for cowslips; so do the old green ginger jars, so
difficult now to come by, with crackle glaze, and low reliefs of
birds and flowers. But if you are staying -in "furnished apartments"
remotely-in the country, it may be of some solace to realize that a
common glass pickle jar may prove a far from uncomely vessel for
woodland spoils. It is, to say the least of it, a welcome refuge from
your landlady's ornamental flower-vases.</P>

<P>Each morn a thousand roses brings in June, and not to the garden
alone, but along the hedgerows and among the underwoods to boot. And
not roses only, but an infinitely varied multitude of less-considered
blooms-less-considered, that is to say, from any practically
decorative standpoint- and yet worthy enough, in all conscience, when
carefully plucked and heedfully disposed, to make unfashionably fair
the chambers or the dinner tables on whose behalf they may be
gathered together. The over-prevalent conception as to the
arrangement of wild flowers is much the same as that which only too
lately obtained with regard to the indoor disposal of more
highly-differentiated growths-a blind conviction, namely, that
flowers being in themselves things of beauty could do no wrong, even
when mixed and mingled in such indiscriminate wise as to hurl
defiance at every law, written or unwritten (and the last are the
more important), of harmony and fitness.</P>

<P>We are come at last to recognize, partially it is true, but still
to recognize-"one glimpse, if dimly, yet indeed revealed"-that it is
a most unprofitable practice to cram as many garden flowers as
possible and of as many different kinds and colours, into the same
vessel; but the lilies of the field are still, even when thought to
deserve the trouble of carrying home and setting in water, used with
scant ceremony and less taste. We are apt to treat them as something
like beggars to whom a half-kindly, half-contemptuous alms is tossed
in passing, or who are allowed to find some transitory solace at the
back door. Snatched clumsily from the parent stem, with no regard for
symmetry of leafage or proportionate length of stalk, borne homewards
in the enervating grasp of hot fingers, and pushed "anyhow" into any
kind of vase that comes handy, there is small matter for wonder that,
as a general rule, the beauty of wild flowers is so sadly to seek
when translated to the house.</P>

<P>And yet, with a very little thought, they are capable of much that
is charming within doors as well as without. And although there is no
lack of blossom and perfume of the cultivated kind, it may
nevertheless be worth while to go out, upon occasion, into the
highways and hedges for your table decorations if for nothing else.
The enterprise is harmless, to say the least of it, and, if the grace
of unfamiliar effects, of chords that you have not already struck a
hundred times over, each summer, can be counted to you as
righteousness, then there is something gained over and above the
pleasure of experimenting with intrinsically attractive material.</P>

<P>So many different schemes are there as yet untried in any
appreciable degree, such a multitude of pleasing potentialities to be
evolved and materialized according to your individual imaginings,
that specific suggestion might almost seem superfluous; but there are
ever changes to ring upon the finest harmonies, ever fresh
combinations to attempt, new intonations to essay, a different
sentiment to symbolize. Indeed, there is practically no limit in full
summer-time and a flowery country, to the arrangements, all more or
less commendable, to which the goodly company of wayside weeds will
lend themselves.</P>

<P>The opaque pallor delicately stained with green, of the waxen wild
bryony blossom, with its sharply serrated leaves, its exquisite
trails arid tendrils full of vaguely classic sentiment-a veritable
hedge Bacchante, as it were-is set off to a marvel by the golden dusk
complexion, the simply subtle curves and romantic lines of old
Japanese bronze. And this should suffice in itself-given, of course,
appropriate guidance, without which the most promising composition
must fall hopelessly to pieces. But. if you should have set your
heart upon fragrance as well as qualities of form and colour, none
can reasonably quarrel with you for filling the very tallest and
slenderest of your bronzes with a great sheaf of meadow-sweet and
setting it in the midst. Again, a by no means unpleasing arrangement
on a somewhat similar plan may be arrived at by means of the wild
clematis-the same that passes the summer as Traveller's Joy, and
tumbles down the vale of autumn as Old Man's Beard-disposed
discreetly in bowls and vases of clear, pale-green glass. Here,
again, the central trophy should be high, and for this you can hardly
find anything more sympathetic than pure white foxgloves. As refined
and researched an arrangement as heart could wish, and, at the same
time, most easy to compass, is a profuse triumph of shell-tinted
blackberry blossom set in vessels of iridescent glass; not, be it
clearly understood, the ordinary iridescent glass of commerce, which,
for all its soap-bubble sheen, - makes appreciably for the
commonplace, but that admirable reproduction-fairwith all the
mysterious poetry of the opal, and lit with the same veiled fires-of
the substance of the antique glass tearcruses found in Etruscan
tombs. Given the finest and whitest of fair linen, the most
delicately frail old silver, and thin white china without spot or
blemish, the effect as a whole has indubitable distinction, while the
detail cannot fail to please</P>

<P>"Do not," says the poetess, "chew the hemlock rank, growing on the
weedy bank," and there is little temptation to disregard her kindly
warning; you may, however, compose a very ethereally pretty
dinner-table decoration from the frail white umbels with their
innumerable tiny blossoms and tender green stalks that flourish, in
all manner of sizes, on grassy banks and beside the hedgerows. To
these you may add, with liberal but judicious hand and distinct
advantage, long-stemmed blooms of tile scabious in all its subtle
varieties of tone and quality, ranging from faintest violet to dull,
rich purple. For this arrangement the best vessels are of airily
fantastic, yet not too elaborately fashioned, Venetian glass, chiefly
white, but throwing out dim, well-subordinated suggestions of pale
green, and blue, hovering on the verge of purple.</P>

<P>The almost austere simplicity of the sweet scented white campion
claims, when obtainable, the pearly tones of old pewter as a
shrine-or else, for second choice, vases of pure white Dresden; and,
if it seems to need companionship, the small gold stars and dark
leaves of the St. John's wort might justly be deemed fit to bear it
company.</P>

<P>Before the high tide of the year the dog-violets have had their
day, together with many another early summer flower; and still,
despite their scentlessness, the remembrance of an oval breakfast
table half-paved with these, set close together in shallow chalices
of old blue glass, whose blunt lapis-lazuli diapers were patterned
with dim gold, still lingers an agreeable memory, and one fraught
with promise of future symphonies in purple and blue. The briar-rose
and the sweet-briar beside, it were best to gather in bud, so soon do
the full blown blossoms fall, and for them, as for other flowers (but
roses always more particularly), forethought will add a few drops of
gal-volatile-it is better than salt-to the water they are to stand
in, thus prolonging to the utmost the freshness which is their life.
And for these wild roses any manner of glass, provided it be of pure
design, rather low than tall of build, and either faintly green or
else colourless, may serve. They will show, moreover, to equal
advantage in daintily sprigged or garlanded, or in fine blue and
white, china bowls.</P>

<P>The cool glories of water-lilies, yellow and white, are too well
appreciated to touch upon here, save to deplore that the vessels they
are set in are never, or hardly ever, of adequate dimensions. It is
pitiable to see them, in their large and lordly beauty, languishing
in puny glass troughs like a swan in a wash-tub; and, indeed, it
seems more than doubtful as to whether from their very nature, and
the sentiment of their association, they are suited to serve as table
or indoor decorations at all.</P>

<P>Suppose a house with an enclosed courtyard, flagged with white
stones between which the grass is growing, and there in the centre a
tank of dull, yellow marble, and you have a fit home for the
domesticated water-lily-that and none other.</P>

<P>At the first blush the discredited and generally odious
&eacute;pergne appears to have outlived its uses altogether, and
this, of course, must still hold good of the intrinsically meaner
kinds; but, the freaks of fashion notwithstanding, there are some
examples left of almost classically elegant design, in Sheffield
plate and finely-cut glass, to which honour and preservation are due.
Such a one, filled with closely-massed bell-heather and its natural
green, airily crowned with the long slim stalks and drooping
grey-blue heads of hare-bells, has found its best furfilment.
Slender, trumpet shaped glasses holding hare-bells, in number
proportionate to the size of the table, should complete the
effect.</P>

<P>"The world," says an old saw, "was never so dull, but if one won't
another will;" and when the rose of yesterday is all but forgotten,
when chrysanthemum sheaves stand ephemeral monuments of desolation,
blackened and forlorn, and the garden is ''a sealed seed-plot" which
only faith can glorify in advance, what should you do but go for
consolation to the next best that offers? From the early span"
flowers that even before Christmas are hawked abroad in the streets,
you turn with a shiver, for of all unseasonable wares these
anticipatory blooms would seem the least in harmony with the spirit
of this moribund time of year, and the least desirable. And, besides,
their pale presence forestalls-discounts, as it were, in some
measure-that thrill of vague unreasoning hopefulness, of foolish
exhilarating anticipation, that comes with the first real spring day.
You should never buy your first bunch of rose or purple anemones, of
white, faintly-fragrant narcissi, or yellow jonquils, until the air
has the moist breath of spring in it, and the sun's gold is the
veritable gold of spring.</P>

<P>It is easy, of course, to have a few bowls and vases for ever
going with hot-house flowers. But what of the multiplicity of
vessels, short and tall, rotund and slender, that are left naked to
laughter when leaves fall and cold winds come?-those vessels set on
side tables, in odd corners, and on chimney-pieces, overflowing with
flowers for three parts of the year in the pride of plenitude, in
winter lorn and disconsolate. They are mostly crowned for a few days
in mid-winter with holly and yew, with mistletoe and laurel, but that
is merely for the moment, and soon the accustomed tenantry of each
will oust the Yuletide usurpers and come to its own again, with,
perhaps, some change of grouping and shifting of place, according to
the inspiration of the disposer or the exigencies of the
background.</P>

<P>It is given but to very few to keep their outlying jars and
flower-vases in fresh blossoms throughout the winter. Indeed the
sentiment of the season forbids it, inclining rather to sympathetic
alliance with those gracious phantoms of summer growth which you may
have, mostly for the plucking, in autumn, and may now and again, if
you have missed your chances then, purchase of the street-hawker
later in the year. They are wraiths, of course, void of scent and
bloom, but yet the fairest and most decorative of spectres; "like
ghosts of pilgrims that have died around the Holy Sepulchre," they
haunt the grave of every summer that is born and has perished, paying
tribute, and bearing witness to, its splendours overpass. They are
ready to step into the breach with their armoury of fragile charms on
the very emergency at which they are most needed: comely and pleasant
were they in their lives, and in death they are not unhonoured.</P>

<P>Indeed, the last state of the Honesty, with its decorative, almost
Japanesque, wealth of shimmering pearly moons, hung on frail stems,
and stitched, as it were, here and there round the edges with a
delicate dark thread, is far more distinctively beautiful than its
first-dainty though the clusters of lilac blossom can be. In the
early summer, a little after the daffodil and a little before the
iris, a few clumps of Honesty in full flower stand up bravely between
the late tulips, making an amethystine mist of bloom very pleasant to
the eye; but the supreme moment of existence is when, the high
seeding stage, dreary and dissipated-looking, being past, the tall,
whitish-grey stalks are cut off close to the ground on some still
autumn day before the rough weather begins, and careful thumb and
finger strip off the dun-coloured casings that cover either side of
the iridescent discs, and let fall the flat round seeds. You must not
forget, however, to humour the plant in this process of-unveiling its
inner mysteriousness, for the delicate film is only too easily torn
or broken off, being as brittle and as unchancy to handle as most
other things of beauty, real and ideal.</P>

<P>Once safely stripped and set in its appointed place, a cluster of
Honesty will last through a winter, even a London winter, in grace
and comeliness. As for the receptacle, it matters little what it may
be, provided only that it is good in form and colour, and not too low
of stature. A Delft or Nankin jar, a slender tapering pitcher of
bronze, an old cloisonne vase with rich dusky blues and vermilions,
in all or either this delectable weed will show to advantage if
judiciously disposed, without overcrowding and with due regard to the
structural character of every spray. If the Honesty harvest have
yielded well, and you can afford to be generous, one of the prettiest
arrangements in the world may be arrived at by crowning a Georgian
copper tea-urn with its shell-like whiteness. The combination is
particularly happy, and shines forth 'from a shadowy recess like a
good deed in a naughty world.</P>

<P>Less easy to arrange, by reason of its habit of growth, but
charming all the same, is the Cape Gooseberry, as it is commonly
called, whose miniature Japanese lanterns of a translucent
orange-red, sometimes full, sometimes delicately faint in colour,
dangle in distracting disarray from their slim supports. For this a
narrow-necked vessel, be it metal or china-glass is obviously out of
the question in the case of all these dried braveries- were
advisable; or else, and this depends entirely upon the position they
are to occupy, you may let them trail from a shallow goblet of not
too insignificant proportions.</P>

<P>The common flag, after it has "come to full flower-time," and
ripened in due course, makes a fine harmony with its tall seed-pod,
where the brown sheath draws back like a split pomegranate to
disclose the large seeds of a luminous red; and with this it is well
to intermingle pale banners of the dried spear-grass and wavering
sedge. It is just possible that in some remote period to come,
generations yet unborn shall rise up and call the bulrush blessed. At
present the wrong is too recent, the abominations that have been
wrought in its image are too often in evidence for appreciation or
even for ordinary justice. Milking stools, umbrella-stands, plaques
in terra-cotta, door panels, and the like, conspire to cast contumely
on this innocent vegetable, as mercilessly maltreated by the amateur
as the sunflower and the stork.</P>

<P>Happily the homely attractions of the honest, and most
decoratively valuable teazle, have not been turned into a reproach by
zealous misrepresentation; it is as welcome as ever to a place of
honour in the larger and more robustly fashioned of our vases. In the
immediate neighbourhood of delicate porcelain it needs not to say
that the teazle, even as pampas grass, were out of place; neither,
and equally, of course, must it be implanted in a small or
meagrely-proportioned vessel; its bold outlines and rugged growth
demand a spacious and not too finely detailed shrine.</P>

<P>Most to be shunned of all so-called immortelles are the odious
dyed grasses, "selected" bundles of which are shamelessly offered for
sale. They are the visible expression of tastelessness and vulgarity,
on the same level, so to speak, with sham begonias in flower-pots and
camellias carved in turnip. And while there are opportunities, so
many and sweet, for justifiable selection, there can be no excuse
whatever for the existence of such monstrosities as these. The
smallest of small beech boughs, such as grow low on the saplings, are
easily attainable, and if gathered at the right time, and not over
often disturbed, will often keep their copper-gold leafage until the
spring. Dried fronds of bracken, too, are admirable in effect, either
together, or when their russet warmth of colour is closely contrasted
with the pale sheen of the Honesty.</P>

<P>In some of the down countries you may find growing near the sea a
pleasing variety of umbels, very graceful and fantastic, while on the
short turf not far away from the hedges that harbour them grow the
short-stemmed thistles, like transmuted moon-daisies with large round
centres of tawny amber velvet, and hard, silvery petals curled
backward. Here, again, but lower down and nearer the shingle, grow
grey sea-thistles. But it is near the scant shelter of the hedgerows
above that you must seek the tall, slim weed that boasts of so
graceful an array of drooping, pitcher-shaped seed vessels, as
refined in form as Greek vases of the best period.</P>

<P>"Red rose-leaves will never make wine," but the coral-coloured,
pear-shaped fruits that remain on the briars will serve, in company
with dried walnut or plane-leaves, in bronze dishes, to render a
winter dessert very fair to see. Walnuts, pears, and apples, to say
nothing of oranges and grapes, are outwardly and exceedingly
glorified by juxtaposition with such wild wood spoils.</P>
