<P><B>Editor's note:</B> This is one of the best literary
descriptions of the change over in style from the High Victorian
townhouse to the Old-Fashioned House, or Old Colony Style (an urban
variant of the Shingle-Style and Queen Anne, which developed into the
Colonial Revival). The young architect in the story may be a sketch
of Stanford White or Arthur Little, both of whom worked in Boston's
Back Bay at this time and set out to reform the prevailing style of
domestic architecture.</P>

<P>When the spring opened Colonel Lapham showed that he had been in
earnest about building on the New Land. His idea of a house was a
brown-stone front, four stories high, and a French roof with an
air-chamber above. Inside, there was to be a reception-room on the
street and a dining-room back. The parlors were to be on the second
floor, and finished in black walnut or parti-colored paint. The
chambers were to be on the three floors above, front and rear, with
side rooms over the front door. Black walnut was to be used
everywhere except in the attic, which was to be painted and grained
to look like black walnut. The whole was to be very high-studded, and
there were to be handsome cornices and elaborate center-pieces
throughout, except, again, in the attic.</P>

<P>These ideas he had formed from the inspection of many new
buildings which he had seen going up, and which he had a passion for
looking into. He was confirmed in his ideas by a master-builder who
had put up a great many houses on the Back Bay as a speculation, and
who told him that if he wanted to have a house in the style, that was
the way to have it.</P>

<P>The beginnings of the process by which Lapham escaped from the
master-builder and ended in the hands of an architect are so obscure
that it would be almost impossible to trace them. But it all
happened, and Lapham promptly developed his ideas of black-walnut
finish, high-studding, and cornices. The architect was able to
conceal the shudder which they must have sent through him. He was
skillful, as nearly all architects are, in playing upon that simple
instrument Man. He began to touch Colonel Lapham's stops.</P>

<P>"Oh, certainly, have the parlors high-studded. But you've seen
some of those pretty, old-fashioned country-houses, haven't you,
where the entrance-story is very low-studded?"</P>

<P>"Yes," Lapham assented.</P>

<P>"Well, don't you think something of that kind would have a very
nice effect? Have the entrance-story low-studded, and your parlors on
the next floor as high as you please. Put your little reception-room
here beside the door, and get the whole width of your house frontage
for a square hall, and an easy low-tread staircase running up three
sides of it. I'm sure Mrs. Lapham would find it much pleasanter." The
architect caught toward him a scrap of paper lying on the table at
which they were sitting and sketched his idea. "Then have your
dining-room behind the hall, looking on the water."</P>

<P>He glanced at Mrs. Lapham, who said, "Of course," and the
architect went on: "That gets you rid of one of those long, straight,
ugly staircases," - until that moment Lapham had thought a long
straight staircase the chief ornament of a house, - "and gives you an
effect of amplitude and space."</P>

<P>"That's so!" said Mrs. Lapham. her husband merely made a noise in
his throat.</P>

<P>"Then, were you thinking of having your parlors together,
connected by folding doors?" asked the architect deferentially.</P>

<P>"Yes, of course," said Lapham. "They're always so, aint they?"</P>

<P>"Well, nearly," said the architect. "I was wondering how would it
do to make one large square room at the front, taking the whole
breadth of the house, and with this hall-space between, have a
music-room back for the young ladies?"</P>

<P>Lapham looked helplessly at his wife, whose quicker apprehension
had followed the architect's pencil with instant sympathy.
"First-rate!" she cried.</P>

<P>The Colonel have way. "I guess that would do. It'll be kine of
odd, wont it?"</P>

<P>"Well, I don't know," said the architect. "Not so odd, I hope, as
the other thing will be a few years from now." He went on to plan the
rest of the house, and he showed himself such a master in regard to
all the practical details that Mrs. Lapham began to feel a motherly
affection for the young man, and her husband could not deny in his
heart that the fellow seemed to understand his business. He stopped
walking about the room, as he had begun to do when the architect and
Mrs. Lapham entered into the particulars of closets, drainage,
kitchen arrangements, and all that, and came back to the table. "I
presume," he said, "you'll have the drawing-room finished in black
walnut?"</P>

<P>"Well, yes," replied the architect, "if you like. But some less
expensive wood can be made just as effective with paint. Of course
you can paint black walnut, too."</P>

<P>"Paint it?" gasped the Colonel.</P>

<P>"Yes," said the architect quietly. "White, or a little off
white."</P>

<P>Lapham dropped the plan he had picked up from the table. His wife
made a little move toward him of consolation or support.</P>

<P>"Of course," resumed the architect, "I know there has been a great
craze for black walnut. But it's an ugly wood; and for a drawing-room
there is really nothing like white paint. We should want to introduce
a little gold here and there. Perhaps we might run a painted frieze
round under the cornice - garlands of roses on a gold ground; it
would tell wonderfully in a white room."</P>

<P>The Colonel returned less courageously to the charge. "I presume
you'll want Eastlake mantel-shelves and tiles?" He meant this for a
sarcastic thrust at a prevailing foible of the profession.</P>

<P>"Well, no," gently answered the architect. "I was thinking perhaps
a white marble chimney-piece, treated in the refined Empire style,
would be the thing for that room."</P>

<P>"White marble!" exclaimed the Colonel. "I thought that had gone
out long ago."</P>

<P>"Really beautiful things can't go out. They may disappear for a
little while, but they must come back. It's only the ugly things that
stay out after they've had their day."</P>

<P>Lapham could only venture very modestly, "Hard-wood floors?"</P>

<P>"In the music room, of course," consented the architect.</P>

<P>"And in the drawing-room?"</P>

<P>"Carpet. Some sort of moquette, I should say. But I should prefer
to consult Mrs. Lapham's taste in that matter."</P>

<P>"And in the other rooms?"</P>

<P>"Oh, carpets, of course."</P>

<P>"And what about the stairs?"</P>

<P>"Carpet. And I should have the rail and banisters white -
banisters turned or twisted."</P>

<P>The Colonel said under his breath, "Well, I'm dumned!" but he gave
no utterance to his astonishment in the architect's presence. When he
went at last, - the session did not end till eleven o'clock, - Lapham
said, "Well, Pert, I guess that fellow's fifty years behind, or ten
years ahead. I wonder what the Ongpeer style is?"</P>

<P>"I don't know. I hated to ask. But he seemed to understand what he
was talking about. I declare, he knows what a woman wants in a house
better than she does herself."</P>

<P>"And a man's simply nowhere in comparison," said Lapham. But he
respected a fellow who could beat him at every point, and have a
reason ready, as this architect had; and when he recovered from the
daze into which the complete upheaval of all his preconceived notions
had left him, he was in a fit state to swear by the architect. It
seemed to him that he had discovered the fellow (as he always called
him) and owned him now, and the fellow did nothing to disturb this
impression. He entered into that brief but intense intimacy with the
Laphams which the sympathetic architect holds with his clients. he
was privy to all their differences of pinion and all their disputes
about the house. He knew just where to insist upon his own ideas, and
where to yield. He was really building several other houses, but he
gave the Laphams the impression that he was doing none but
theirs.</P>
