<P><B>TEA AND ITS SERVICE</B></P></CENTER>

<P>WHEN leaves fall and cold winds come, and the voice of the
muffin-bell is heard in the land; when the roses are gone where the
late-lingering autumn blooms soon must follow, then the red and
golden hearth resumes its sway as the most important factor in daily
life, and indoor comfort again is lord of all. That, preeminently, is
the season of afternoon tea. On the green cedar-shaded lawn, in the
cool summer parlour, the tinkle of tea-cups and the murmur of the urn
are less in sympathy with the sentiment of the hour than the clink of
the ice-pail and the sound of the lemon-squeezers. Comely and
reviving as is the ceremony in all seasons, the true sentiment of the
tea-table flowers only at its fullest in autumnal and in wintry
twilights, before the candles are lit, when the firelight makes
mirrors for itself of wainscoted walls and polished surfaces, and
moving shadows bend and beckon from the corners in fantastic
invitation to both memory and imagination at once. Even as the dead
and buried roses, mourned by Gerda, forsook their places in the wise
woman's garden to bloom in painted semblance the winter through upon
their mistress's tall, steeple-crowned hat, it might be thought that
the rosy garlands on our tea-cups and saucers had come thither in
like manner to blossom in purple and red from wind-swept plea saunce
and desolate parterre. But, fantasy apart, it is indisputable that a
certain atmosphere of romance must always cling to an old china tea
service, and not to the service alone, but to all the manifold
appurtenances of its dainty equipage. An atmosphere born partly of
association with a courtly age, not too remote for realization in
thought, and yet sufficiently far for the enchantment of distance;
partly of the obvious antithesis-the unappealing pathos, if you
will-that attaches to all frail inanimate things of intimate usage
that have long survived their possessors, passing from hand to hand,
from-hearth to hearth, hung round with lost memories and garlanded
with faded circumstance as with dead flowers. Every day that comes
and goes is the day of small things, and small things have a power
and a dignity of their own that only the dull may despise.</P>

<P>From the " tea-cup times," when tee was sold at ten shillings a
pound and more, and tulip bulbs were as costly as orchids are now,
to- the days of Charles Lamb and his hyson, which he was
"old-fashioned enough to drink unmixed still of an afternoon," and up
to the present, the practice of tea-drinking has of course varied
appreciably as to hour, and perhaps a little as to manner; but such
changes are as nothing compared to those that have overtaken the
wherewithal of its fulfillment. From the shallow, handleless cup of
almost translucent blue and white porcelain, not much deeper or
larger than the chalice of a windflower, and scarcely less delicate
of texture and design, to the more solid splendours of Worcester,
Crown Derby, Spode, and the like; from these again to the blowsy
begilded cheeks and bloated forms of early, and late, Victorian
atrocities, the road is long, and the full enumeration too tedious to
be entered upon here. On this head it needs only to say that good-as
we shall presently see-as are some of the modern examples, there is
none that does not, directly or indirectly, owe the glories of its
birth and state to older models, and the more direct the debt the
greater the glory.</P>

<P>For the older models are incomparably the finest; they excel
easily in shape, colour, design, and, above all, in that nameless
poetry of effect which partakes of all these excellences, and yet is
definitely embodied in none; the soul, in short, that inhabits every
work of art, that looks out from the canvases of Matthys Maris, and
Velasquez, that sings in the lyrics from " The Princess." More
elusive and manifold of aspect than Thetis herself, it shifts from
one form to another, and yet is ever the same in essence, and ever to
be recognized, whether dwelling in a painting that is for all time, a
Grecian urn, a goblet of Cellini's craftsmanship, or even " in that
world before perspective- a china tea-cup." Innumerable are the
factitious sighs, mostly lyrical, that have been heaved for the snows
of yester-year, but the ballad of broken china is still to sing; the
irreparable breakages of the last ninety years or so, to say the
least of it; the shattered sets whose remaining wreckage bears
piteous witness to the grievousness of their destruction, they are
all uncelebrated in song. But, although so much is lost, and with the
rest Elia's "set of extraordinary old blue china (a recent
purchase)," there is yet much to be glad for as regards such examples
of bygone taste and skill that time, and a long succession of
neat-handed Phyllises, have chanced to spare. And of the multitude,
perhaps the loveliest and the best, from the purely artistic point of
view, of course, is the old Oriental blue and white, with its
exquisite texture, its incomparable blue, its inimitable white, that
is in reality neither white, nor bluish-white, nor grey, nor pearl
colour; its graceful forms, its preposterously charming designs, as
impossibly sweet as a fairy tale or a pleasant dream But this
preference may, after all, however in sensibly, be in some measure
the outcome of an individual prepossession; and, however that may be,
there are sets in other kinds of ware so good that it were unwise to
dogmatize upon their comparative virtues, the more especially as in
shape and capacity these last are generally closer fitted to the
exigencies of modern convenience than the cherished Nankin.</P>

<P>To particularize. One very fine example of a Worcester tea-service
is, like so much other English ware, distinctly Oriental in
inspiration And here the principal charm lies in the rich and
decorative qualities of colour and design: each piece is painted with
alternate panels, so to speak, of white, with a patterning of dusky
red flowers and green leaves; and deep, dark blue, with one
conventionalized red flower placed in the centre of the panel. With
this set the caddy is superseded by a graceful little tea jar, small
enough to bring to mind the contemporary costliness of the fragrant
leaves it was wont to contain.</P>

<P>Of a lighter cast of beauty is another set of Worcester, the cups
handleless, and most elegantly fluted, the ground white; engirdled,
with an admirable sense of spacing and proportion, by bands of rich
deep blue, as rich as lapis-lazuli and darker, these bands being
relieved with golden stars and ribands. While lighter still in motive
is a white set, also Worcester, besprent with dusky blue flowers and
slim traceries of small gold leaves and tendrils. Worcester, once
more, and this time of a delight</P>

<P>fully dainty frivolity, is a transfer set in grisaille, wherein
gaiety and versatility may be seen to reign with equal sway.</P>

<P>Here you have every piece tricked out with a different subject,
and each more or less after "le paradis de Watteau"-ladies with hoops
and powdered hair, receiving gallants with full-skirted coats and
high-heeled shoes, in stately gardens; backgrounds of weeping willow,
classic urn, and laughing Abigail; foregrounds of formal flower
plots, frisking lap-dogs, gardening implements, and what not-all the
pretty, half-prim, half-wanton affectations of the period seem
gathered together to make perennial merriment within these miniature
bounds.. And, if the charm of colour be missing, the spirit of
old-world festas, the charm of old-world quaintness should serve to
atone.</P>

<P>Two notable instances of tea-services decorated, and to advantage,
with armorial bearings, are both old Venetian of make, the one bold
in design and almost barbarously fine in the opulence of its
richly-massed colour; while the other, which also boasts a groundwork
of white, shows a contrasting delicacy in colour and in
character.</P>

<P>It reposes in pleasing completeness, and its original red leather
casket lined with white velvet; each elegant little vessel bearing on
one side the coat of arms in varying shades of pale amethyst, and on
the other a tenderly-coloured group of fruit and flowers.</P>

<P>So hard it were to choose between the rival attractions of at
least half-a-dozen admirable makes of porcelain, that the only ideal
arrangement is to possess several services. Happy is she who has -
her china-closet full of them, for what can be more sincerely
luxurious than the Japanesque practice of putting away one beautiful
thing for a season, and taking out another whose charms,
half-forgotten, take on an added potency in the recognition? Before
custom shall have had the chance to stale your pleasure in the
blue-flowered Spode, how well it were to substitute something
different in character although no less alluring of aspect.</P>

<P>For such as may be fortunate enough to have the means and the
disposition to ring every few months or oftener, as inclination
prompts, the changes on their tea-cups-to relegate oneset to safe and
honourable retirement and transfer another into daily use-there is
little fear of becoming insensible to the charms of their
possessions. Suppose, for example, the whim takes you for something
of a daintier, more austere, beauty than the robust and candid
comeliness of the old Spode service that may have graced your
tea-table for the last few months, with its cobalt-blue variant on
the willow-pattern motive, enriched with rims and arabesques of
highly-burnished gold. Then your eye-grown accustomed to the
bounteous outlines of the buxom tea-pot, generously large and broad m
the beam as a Dutch fishing-boat, the correspondingly comfortable,
yet by no means unshapely, squabness of sugar-bowl and cream ewer,
and thus in a state to re-discover with revived enthusiasm the
severer elegances of (say) a Chelsea Derby set, of Bristol
pattern-would rest with accentuated complacence upon the slender
proportions of the substitute, and your pleasure in the possession of
both should be appreciably enhanced. If absence does not precisely
make the heart grow fonder, or familiarity invariably breed contempt,
it must at least be admitted that an admired object shows all the
fairer after a brief period of separation, when you are brought to a
fresh realization of its merits; and that aesthetic sensibilities
towards the smaller appurtenances of daily life are apt by force of
habit to become dulled. Doubly elegant and chaste of form and colour
will seem such a service as the Chelsea Derby we have in mind-slim,
almost to severity, of shape, diagonally fluted, of a white
particularly pure, garlanded in virginal simplicity with light
traceries of little grass-green leaves and blossoms-after a diurnal
familiarity with an ampler and more ornate kind of beauty. A not
unworthy successor, in its turn, to this, might be found in a Chelsea
service of much refinement, the ground white, with low, pear shaped
flutings alternatively white and sapphire blue, surmounted by green
and golden garlands behind which dawns faintly a blurred band of
amethystine pink Or, if daintiness be the order of the day, an Amstel
set, primrose and white, sprigged with all manner of small delicate
flowers, should be regarded with more than temporary favour; while a
Hague constellation of like purpose, adorned with a sequence of
subjects in the manner of Lancret; or a Dresden service decorated in
pale shell-tints, with airy flights of amorini, somewhat reminiscent
of Boucher's gayest meinies, might be found far from amiss in certain
moods.</P>

<P>For quaintness, or haply for the sake of contrast, -the more
especially in a country house during the shooting season-an old
Berlin tea-set, painted with Bewickesque presentations of wild birds
and game, most minute and careful in detail, and with some pretty
qualities of colour, may serve its turn; but the much vaunted
splendours of S&eacute;vres and Capo di Monte, however highly, and
perhaps justly, esteemed from the collector's point of view, are not
very deeply to be desired for either active service or passive
decoration by those to whom true refinement of character and artistic
distinction are more essential in their household vessels and
ornaments than commercial, or pedantic, value.</P>

<P>To the majority, of course, a wide repertory of old tea-services,
and to many the possession of even one-in perfect condition-is out of
the question, for sufficiently obvious reasons. But although economy
may have to be studied, there is yet room enough for tact and taste,
and for pleasure beside, in the choosing. It is possible, for
instance-that is to say, if your heart be fixed on a tea-service that
bears the stamp of an earlier and more spontaneously decorative
period than the present-to purchase for inconsiderable sums the still
graceful survivors of what has been an ample and a beautiful set. But
in such a case you must prepare to be philosophical, and content
yourself with perhaps no more than four or five unblemished cups and
saucers, counting yourself fortunate if tea-pot, cream-ewer,
sugar-bowl, and slop-basin be found intact. It seems hardly necessary
to say that cracked or chipped china- unless, in lean years, destined
to make colour behind the diamond-paned doors of a dimly-placed
corner cupboard-is an ill bargain. For anything approaching to
practical purposes it is obviously not to be thought of.</P>

<P>But when the old-fashioned porcelain tea-pot, together with its
usual satellites, is found in unimpeachable preservation it is very
well worth having indeed. Not that the admirable effect of a
combination of daintily painted china cups with the starry glitter of
silver vessels should be undervalued or ignored, for it is pleasing
enough in all conscience; but it is nevertheless advisable to
appreciate and esteem the tea-pot that is uniform with its
dependencies in material and design. In the first place, it repeats
and emphasizes the usually fine note of colour struck by the minor
pieces; and, in the second, it has a way of suffering most excellent
tea to be made in the hidden recesses of its comely being. It has,
moreover, to be remembered that many and many a silver tea equipage,
intrinsically irreproachable, is so unlovely of mould as to make
companionship with finely shaped cups and saucers harmoniously
impossible. The dark years that are as yet such a little way behind
us produced some of their most lasting memorials in such florid forms
as these.</P>

<P>Tea-services of pure white china, very fairly good in texture, are
now to be had at small cost to the buyer; and these, if not the
height of the heart's desire, are at least blameless; and at most,
used with fine and spotless damask, charming in quality of tone. The
subtleties of one white upon another seem scarce sufficiently
appreciated as yet in details of decoration. Then there are some
quite passable alternatives in cheap modern Oriental wares that put
no undue strain upon a slender purse, the most pleasing and
unpretentious being in blue and white, while the spurious Satsuma and
Kaga should be left severely alone.</P>

<P>As regards the modern replicas and adaptations of old models, they
leave-save for the sentiment, and for certain differences in
mellowness of tone that may only be remedied by time-but little to be
desired. True that all antique blue-and-white pottery and porcelain
must, of sheer necessity, be set aside as impossible of imitation,
the quality of colour in the white alone presenting an all-sufficient
obstacle; but this notwithstanding, there is available a. wide range
of exceedingly charming designs, which the discriminating reproducer
may revive without fear and without reproach.</P>

<P>Among the most remarkable of these replicas is a faithful copy of
a Spode service, which attracts by its bold dignity of design and
refined and splendid colour. An ultramarine ground, verging almost on
purple, bears a device, very large in feeling and more than touched
with Orientalism, of strange flowers and leaves, in amethysts,
greens, dusky carnations, and dim white-the effect produced being
much akin to those many-coloured posies of single anemones sold by.
flower-hawkers m early spring. Another Spode reproduction, entirely
different in character, has on a white ground three rows of tiny
upright rose-stocks, as prim as prim can be, but of a sweet austerity
that greatly pleases the eye.</P>

<P>And Spode again is a most delightful arrangement on cups and
saucers, generous in size, of great full-blown cabbage-roses
clustered together upon a burnished gilt ground around a central gilt
arabesque. This, indeed, is a triumph of frankly florid ornament,
full of vivacity and distinction. Very dainty is a rain and ruin of
roses in a mist of powdered gold, a reproduction of an old Derby
pattern: here the vessels are small and somewhat slenderly shaped.
The mock jewelled Coalport services present a displeasing contrast to
such as these. They appear as though intended for the use of Sir
Gorgius Midas and his compeers, overloaded as they are with
meretricious ornament, heavy with opaque and unimaginative hues, and
thickly bedizened with gold. Of the many admirable reproductions
after old models there is here neither time nor space to speak; their
name is fortunately Legion-but among the cloud of witnesses there are
two that claim especial commendation: one, a Crown Derby device, has
a white bow-fluted ground, besprent with tiny dark blue cornflowers
and dark green leaves; the other set is also white, but sprigged with
a multitude of little yellow wild roses. Among adaptations a white
bow-fluted service, bordered with small carnations and gold foliage,
bears off the palm; while absolutely the best purely modern instance
is a Copeland set, in white, amber, and pale green, with a most
graceful and purely-coloured design of buttercups springing athwart
the always elegant bow-flutings.</P>
