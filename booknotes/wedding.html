<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>The Marriage ceremony varies with the fortunes and wishes of those
interested.</P>

<P>In regard to the form of the rite, no specific directions are
necessary; for those who are to be married by ministers, will study
the form of their particular church - the Methodists their "Book of
Discipline," the Episcopalians their "Book of Common Prayer," the
Catholics their Ritual, etc., etc. In most cases a rehearsal of the
ceremony is made in private, that the pair may the more perfectly
understand the necessary forms. If the parties are to be wedded by a
magistrate, the ceremony is almost nominal - it is a mere repetition
of a vow. The Catholic and Episcopal forms have the most ceremony,
and doubtless are the most impressive, though no more effectually
marrying than the simplest form.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>GENERAL RULES</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>There are, however, some generally received rules which govern
this momentous and interesting occasion, and to these we refer all
interested.</P>

<P>When the wedding is not strictly in private, it is customary for
bridesmaids and groomsmen to be chosen to assist in the duties of the
occasion.</P>

<P>The bridesmaids should be younger than the bride, their dresses
should be conformed to hers; they should not be any more expensive,
though they are permitted more ornament. They are generally chosen of
light, graceful material; flowers are the principal decoration.</P>

<P>The bride's dress is marked by simplicity. But few jewels or
ornaments should be worn, and those should be the gift of the
bridegroom or parents. A veil and garland are the distinguishing
features of the dress.</P>

<P>The bridesmaids assist in dressing the bride, receiving the
company, etc.; and, at the time of the ceremony, stand at her left
side, the first bridesmaid holding the bouquet and gloves.</P>

<P>The groomsmen receive the clergyman, present him to the couple to
be married, and support the bridegroom upon the right, during the
ceremony.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>CONGRATULATIONS AFTER THE
CEREMONY</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>If it is an evening wedding, at home immediately after "these
twain are made one," they are congratulated: first by the relatives,
then by the friends, receiving the good wishes of all; after which,
they are at liberty to leave their formal position, and mingle with
the company. The dresses, supper, etc., are usually more festive and
gay than for a morning wedding and reception, where the friends stop
for a few moments only, to congratulate the newly-married pair, taste
the cake and wine and hurry away.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>CEREMONY IN CHURCH</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>When the ceremony is performed in church, the bride enters at the
left, with her father, mother, and bridesmaids; or, at all events,
with a bridesmaid. The groom enters at the right, followed by his
attendants. The parents stand behind, the attendants at either
side.</P>

<P>The bride should be certain that her glove is readily removable;
the groom, that the ring is where he can find it, to avoid delay and
embarrassment.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>LEAVING THE CHURCH</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>When they leave the church, the newly-married couple walk
arm-in-arm. They have usually a reception of a couple of hours at
home, for their intimate friends, then a breakfast, then leave upon
the 'bridal tour.'</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>MARRIAGE-FEES</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>A rich man may give the officiating clergyman any sum from five
dollars to five hundred, according as his liberality dictates. A
person of moderate means may give from five dollars to twenty.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>LET JOY BE UNCONFINED</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>On such festive occasions, all appear in their best attire, and
assume their best manners. Peculiarities that pertain to past days,
or have been unwarily adopted, should be guarded against; mysteries
concerning knives, forks, and plates, or throwing 'an old shoe' after
the bride, are highly reprehensible, and have long been exploded.
Such practices may seem immaterial, but they are not so. Stranger
guests often meet at a wedding breakfast; and the good breeding of
the family may be somewhat compromised by neglect in small
things.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>THE WEDDING BREAKFAST</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>If the lady appears at breakfast, which is certainly desirable,
she occupies, with her husband, the center of the table, and sits by
his side - her father and mother taking the top and bottom, and
showing all honor to their guests. When the cake has been cut, and
every one is helped - when, too, the health of the bride and
bridegroom has been drunk, and every compliment and kind wish has
been duly proffered and acknowledged - the bride, attended by her
friends, withdraws; and when ready for her departure the
newly-married couple start off on their wedding journey, generally
about two or three o'clock, and the rest of the company shortly
afterward take their leave.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>SENDING CARDS</B> </FONT></CENTER>

<P>In some circles it is customary to send cards almost immediately
to friends and relations, mentioning at what time and hour the
newly-married couple expect to be called upon. Some little
inconvenience occasionally attends this custom, as young people may
with to extend their wedding tour beyond the time first mentioned,
or, if they go abroad, delays may unavoidably occur. It is therefore
better to postpone sending cards, for a short time at least.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>WEDDING CARDS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Fashions change continually with regard to wedding cards. A few
years since they were highly ornamented, and fantastically tied
together; now silver-edged cards are fashionable; but,
unquestionably, the plainer and more unostentatious a wedding card,
the more becoming and appropriate it will be.</P>

<P>No one to whom a wedding-card has not been sent ought to call upon
a newly-married couple.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>CALLING ON A NEWLY-MARRIED
COUPLE</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>When the days named for seeing company arrive, remember to be
punctual. Call, if possible, the first day, but neither before nor
after the appointed hour. Wedding-cake and wine are handed round, of
which every one partakes, and each expresses some kindly wish for the
happiness of the newly-married couple.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A JOYOUS PERIOD</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Taking possession of their home by young people is always a joyous
period. The depressing influence of a wedding breakfast, where often
the hearts of many are sad, is not felt, and every one looks forward
to years of prosperity and happiness.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>PROFESSIONAL CALL WHILE RECEIVING
CALLS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>If the gentleman is in a profession, and it happens that he cannot
await the arrival of such as call according to invitation on the
wedding-card, and apology must be made, and, if possible, an old
friend of the family should represent him. A bride must on no account
receive her visitors without a mother, or sister, or some friend
being present, not even if her husband is at home. This is
imperative. To do otherwise is to disregard the usages of
society.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>RETURNING WEDDING
VISITS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Wedding visits must be returned during the course of a few days,
and parties are generally made for the newly-married couple, which
they are expected to return. This does not, however, necessarily
entail much visiting; neither is it expected from young people, whose
resources may be somewhat limited, or when the husband has to make
his way in the world.</P>
