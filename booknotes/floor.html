<P>"THE ground," says Artemus Ward, " flew up and hit me on the
head;" which deplorable episode, unhappily, is far from being unique
or even uncommon. Many carpets do; to say nothing of other kinds of
floor-covering, and are, in consequence, gey ill to live wi'. To be
sure, there is at the present time a very fair proportion of really
admirable modern carpets, but a few years ago there was no room for
selection; it was merely a case of Hobson's choice. If you could
afford Persian carpets you took them and were happy- if not, you must
needs either have raised the faculty of ignoring to the rank of a
fine art, or lived as much as possible out of doors. Nothing
imaginable could be more blatantly offensive in every decorative
sense, even from the most rudimentary point of view, than the carpets
of yesteryear, with their hard, noisy colours, their base and
demonstrative designs, now made in simulation of some glaringly
inappropriate natural object, now aping the textile semblance of
other fabrics with a sickening verisimilitude that haunts the memory
like the recollection of a bad dream, or of some especially idiotic
comic song long out of date. Perhaps these counterfeit presentments
of blowsy flowers, sprawling ferns, seaweeds, watered silk, and so
forth, were at their very worst when made in Brussels carpeting; but
even the softening influence of deep pile was of small avail as a
disguise to their native, invincible hideousness, which outraged
every law of taste, and laughed, naked and unashamed, in the face of
fitness.</P>

<P>Carpets, like wall-coverings-and it may be even to a greater
degree-must act primarily as backgrounds for all objects placed over
them: harmonious, unobtrusive, at least a tone or two lower than
aught else in the room, the ideal carpet should be seen, not noticed.
The design of it, like the design of a Monticelli, must never jump to
the eyes, but only detach itself in deliberate revealment under
stress of earnest contemplation. Form must dissolve into form, tone
into tone, colour into colour, with the pleasant dimness of
underwoods in summer, or reflections in a dark glass or a shadowed
pool. The design may be as intricate as you please, or as simple, but
it must not assert, it must not obviously repeat itself. As an
accomplished artist dissimulates his mastery of line, so must the
carpet designer weave around and over the fine curves, the
symmetrical forms of his pattern, a clear obscurity of illusion that
shall enhance while half veiling their graces.</P>

<P>As for colour, it may be as rich as you please (always considering
the scheme and key of the room), but it must, before all, be mellow.
A carpet should, as it were, glow forth with a subdued splendour of
colour from between the furniture set upon it, keeping at the same
time its proper place in the general harmony, and fulfilling the
first law of its being by an appearance of reposeful reticence and
sober wealth. It is easy to err in the matter of carpeting; when
floors were strewn with rushes, there was little latitude for
ill-doing, but now there is every opportunity for the heedless,
together with a multiplicity of temptations for the tasteless. A
large design carried out definitely in rich, striking colours will
destroy your furniture as certainly as a hungry, able-bodied cat will
absorb an unprotected canary; while the self-same patterning,
rendered in dim, low-toned dyes, may, on the other hand, look all
that a fond heart could wish.</P>

<P>To-day there are three alternatives-the last indubitably the best,
albeit, perhaps, the costliest. The deep pile carpet of one rich,
dull hue, with an arabesque, renaissance, or geometrically patterned
border, is good, and very good; and altogether estimable, again, is
that which bears a powdering-in a lighter tone of the same colour as
the ground-of finely-conventionalized forms at proper intervals,
blurred with a becoming vagueness. Pleasing species of this genus,
for example, are presented in a colour-chord of green, dim, yet pure
in quality, bearing a device of Empire laurel-garlands, tied (as it
will be remembered) with graceful knots of ribbon; and in a symphony
of lapis-lazuli and a fainter blue, the pattern of which is a
charmingly conceived Japanese convention for a lotus. Both these, of
course, have appropriate borders. But comely and reviving though
they, and some others into the bargain, may be, an old Persian
carpet, in a good state of preservation, is infinitely to be
preferred. The broken tones, the delightful variations of the pile,
the jewelled maze of colour, with its myriad surprises; dim, for all
its splendour, as a rose under water in prison; the strangely
beautiful, outlandish shapes, born of an ancient civilization,
another race and time, and placed much as a master of painting places
his composition on the canvas- all this, fair with an unfamiliar
excellence, charms always and charms wisely. Age cannot wither nor
custom stale the attractions of a really fine Persian carpet; its
indistinct and infinite variety -half dissimulated under the pious
presence of repetition-would alone keep your affection for it quick
and lively, your fidelity firm. In such case you may possibly change
your faiths, your friends, but not-most assuredly not-your
carpet.</P>

<P>Time was when the possession of a Turkey carpet was almost as
recognizedly the outward and visible sign of financial and
respectable grace as that of a gig; and, indeed, it is always
estimable if often unattractive. When very old and faded it is
decidedly a thing to be desired, but the ordinary Turkey carpet of
commerce rejoices in a magenta movement that massacres everything in
its neighbourhood. Like a late distinguished warrior, it charges the
enemy with horrid imprecations and notable effect; wherefore, in
spite of its pleasing texture, it were better let alone.</P>

<P>For rooms where the decorations are set in a high key, with white
and gold, and painted flower engarlanded walls, nothing but an
Aubusson is possible. The pearly, yet warm, greys and fawns, besprent
with faint delicate traceries of roses and ribbons, of this veritable
Ronsard among carpets, suit admirably with the pale elegance of a
certain type of decoration, the type that is penetrated with a
sentiment of stately frivolity, and an old world atmosphere of faded
gaieties and forgotten galas. And if, as may very well be, real
Aubusson be out of reach, there is now no lack of excellent modern
replicas from which to choose.</P>

<P>The floor itself should, obviously, be darker than the carpet, in
the same proportion as the carpet is darker than the rest of the
room; old or new parquet, of variously coloured woods; or plain,
perfectly laid and fitted, planks of oak almost black with age, or of
-Indian teak, are all admirable alternatives. And, failing these, the
parquet that is in reality but a cunning veneer, bought by the yard,
and laid at inconsiderable cost, is eminently satisfactory.</P>

<P>Halls and stairs and corridors are best carpeted when completely
covered with thick pile of one deep full colour: best, that is to
say, in a house that harbours no children, dogs, or cats-a house
wherein the dwellers are few, and dainty of habit. The heedless
comings and goings of a large family mean perpetual demoralization to
a plain carpet, whereon the mark of a muddyboot is as conspicuous as
the memorable footstep of Friday, and little less startling. And here
a new kind of carpet, called Roman, offers itself, and seems to solve
the difficulty. It is thick and substantial, with a pleasing
coarseness of grain, that does not make at all for hardness of
effect. The colours are good, and there is just enough patterning,
artistically blurred -the small, conventional designs are scattered
over a plain ground-to ignore, if not to dissemble, the filthy
witness of the street. Of the dismal, the disgustful, oilcloth; of
the dreary, tessellated pavement, invariably (and wherefore?) odious
in design and colour to boot, there is nothing to be said-their case
is desperate and unalterable, and their popularity founded on the
solid rock of bad taste. It is more profitable to reflect upon the
large alternating diamonds of black marble and white that still pave
some old halls, both here and in Holland, and also upon a comely sort
of coarse mosaic, recently produced, which is made of thick dull
glass.</P>
