<P>A collection of original watercolor designs for wallpapers by
Jennie B. Jones came to light discovered by old-house buffs in a
suburb near Boston, Mass. at a yard sale. Mounted on presentation
board and gathered in a design album with its original black burlap
cover, these thirty-or-so designs form a remarkable ensemble of
patterns from the 1905-1910 period. Although many of the designs had
names and numbers, it is unclear if they were prepared to be sold for
production of wallpaper, or were perhaps used as a teaching aid.
Among the designs are patterns exhibiting historicism (Ancient
Egyptian, Renaissance and Japanese among them), and many forms of
floral designs, drawn in different manners but generally representing
wildflowers of the Cape and coastal areas of Massachusetts.</P>

<P>The biographical information on Jennie B. Jones is scant, but more
has recently come to light. From her signature on the drawings, three
addresses are known, in Brooklyn, NY, Sandwich, Massachusetts, and
Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts. She grew up in Melrose Highlands, a
suburb of Boston, and occasionally lived, as an adult, with her
parents and sister in the family home there. Summers were spent on
Cape Cod, in Sandwich, and many of her designs are of common New
England plants (sumac, goldenrod, marsh mallow, summer phlox, etc.)
that produce fruit or blossoms in late summer. Jennie B. Jones taught
art in Brooklyn, New York as well, and these designs may have been
studies to instruct students for an industrial arts course. For
whatever reason they were originally intended, their survival, and
their arrival at Burrows &amp; Company, was a fortunate twist of
fate, and we are very pleased to present the first group of her
patterns.</P>

         <P>An American design patterned after the Napoleonic
         archaeological drawings of patterns in the ancient Egyptian
         ruins at Thebes. Inspired, perhaps, by the celebrated
         Egyptian collection at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, or from a
         print in a book on historic ornament, Jones adds her own
         interpretation to the original interlacing Lotus arches with
         a simple motif of a standing lotus blossom filling the
         center of each arch, drawn with the simplicity of the Arts
         &amp; Crafts Movement. In Jones interpretation of this
         ancient design, she also brings forward the characteristic
         curves of the Art Nouveau, the latest fashion from
         Europe.<B> </B>27&quot; wide with a self match repeat of 27&quot;

         <P><B>Florentine Major</B>, based on delicate Renaissance arabesques that were +
         highly popular in late 19th and early 20th century interior design. This version has a 
         hint of Art Nouveau in the spring of the curves, and there is an element in the design 
         that creates a formal asymmetry in the overall pattern, making a lively, but elegant and 
         sophisticated design. 21&quot; wide with a self match repeat of 21&quot;. 6 yard long rolls, 
         covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. Metallic gold on Thebes blue, 
         or a medium green on cream.    $155.00 per single roll.</P>

         <P><B>Summer Phlox </B>is familiar to most New England gardeners as a hardy 
         and showy flower from late summer, filling in borders and flower beds after the 
         spring flowers fade. Large floral prints became highly fashionable in the late 19th 
         and early 20th century, especially for walls of large hallways (stairhalls), and dining 
         rooms (often above major panelling), particularly in late Queen Anne Revival and 
         Colonial Revival houses. It is equally at home with natural woodwork or with woodwork 
         painted off-white. 21&quot; wide with a drop match repeat of 21&quot;. 6 yard long rolls, 
         covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. Shades of sage green with greyed 
         Lavender.    $185 per single roll.</P>
