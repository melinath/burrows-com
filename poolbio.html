<P>It is always pleasant to dwell upon a literary career,
unpretentious, not stimulated by greed, nor coddled by fulsome
flatteries, - a career so simple, so sincere, so honest, so generous,
as that of Maria Louise Pool. Her life began in the little
Massachusetts town of <A HREF="rock.html">Rockland,</A> within ten
miles of the coast, when the century was but little more than
two-score years old, and ended there last May, just when her fame was
close upon its culmination and her power had developed by the slow
growth of years.</P>

<P>Fifty-six years ago New England was, really, what the aggressive
West sometimes calls it to-day, provincial.</P>

<P>Along that low-lying coast that stretched monotonous levels
southward from the Boston of that day, the old farm-houses were far
more numerous than the stately colonial mansions that skirted the Bay
farther seaward.</P>

<P>Out of them, in the short, pale New England spring, when the
arbutus was opening its pink buds in the pine woods along the shore
and mingling its fragrance with the sea scent that was blown in by
the east wind, came sturdy yeomen, who sailed away to the Banks or
southward to the Cape, intent upon earning by honest toil a
livelihood for the wives and children left behind; and when winter
froze the earth and the dank marshes were dun and desolate, and the
sullen sea roared, they returned - those that the sea had spared - to
the shelter of their homes.</P>

<P>I do not know that Miss Pool's father shared in the sea ventures,
but I know that he took part in that humble industry - shoe
manufacturing - which grew at last into a splendid commercial
enterprise, that built beautiful homes and schools and churches, that
educated hosts of bright boys and girls, and made a broader and
nobler life possible, - that endowed libraries, and enriched with the
treasures of literature thousands of humble homes.</P>

<P>Elias and Lydia Lane Pool were the parents of four children, a son
and three daughters. the subject of this sketch was the third child,
born into one of those broad-roofed, quaint houses, on August 20,
1841.</P>

<P>It would seem to those of us who know only the world of to-day, a
strange and lonesome world to be born into, - a world without-the
development of electricity, without an ocean cable or telegraph
wires.</P>

<P>It was said of the Pools and the Lanes that they always knew their
own minds, and always had minds to know, and so, no doubt, the second
little daughter - Maria Louise - came naturally by her gifts.</P>

<P>The Rockland Public Library owed its inception to her father. It
grew from a mere handful of volumes to the large and fine collection
which to-day offers such generous opportunities to the
townspeople.</P>

<P>The old-fashioned farm-house standing close upon the street looked
over a wide sweep of pasture and tillage land rolling away to the
southwest, broken by clumps of orcharding and forest, sparsely dotted
by pretty, rural homes won by labor and economy, and supplied an
interminable play-ground to the two youngest children, both active,
fun-loving girls.</P>

<P>These "low hills which I love," wrote the authoress many years
later, are to-day unpicturesquely monotonous to an unloving eye
accustomed to bolder scenery, and must fain borrow somewhat from the
imagination. <IMG SRC="images/poolhouse.gif" WIDTH=294 HEIGHT=223 ALIGN=right></P>

<P>It is easy to fancy that the sea is breaking in just beyond that
low sky - as indeed it is, and not easy to realize that just back of
the house, creeping up the hill, is the busy, prosperous village, the
whole curiously commingling town and country.</P>

<P>In those early days the rural phase predominated, and so this girl
may be truly said to have been country bred, as every human being
should be, - the life of towns agreeing best with maturer years.</P>

<P>By the free life possible in this rural seclusion, Miss Pool built
up a constitution which, though she remained delicate all her
girlhood, developed in middle life into a robustness which ought to
have carried her far on into a hale old age, and which did make
practicable an amount of literary work which would have seemed
enormous to a weaker hand.</P>

<P>She never played with dolls or was interested in those games
commonly like by the feminine child.</P>

<P>When she was about ten years old her father took her one day to
Boston to see the play Uncle Tom's Cabin performed at the Boston
Museum.</P>

<P>This was an epoch-making experience.</P>

<P>Thereafter Maria Louise and her little sister acted plays for
pastime, the mother and eldest sister serving for audience.</P>

<P>She had lived in an atmosphere of books, but the fresh sea winds
had forbidden any mildew of precocity, anything incompatible with a
healthy natural existence. She had been a reader of stories and she
had seen a story actualized upon the stage. Her strong dramatic
instincts were powerfully stimulated.</P>

<P>Many a drama was wrought out in the busy brain of the bright girl,
who daily paced the quiet street to and from the public school.</P>

<P>Her teachers thought her school compositions marvelous, and it may
be that their cordial praises awoke the first faint consciousness of
power, - the first ambition to become a part of the literary life of
her time. then, too, there came naturally that common-sense,
practical desire to become of some importance to her family, to take
upon herself the onus of her own support.</P>

<P>In those days, in New England, the young woman who wished to do
something for herself, was understood to be predestined to the
school-room. But sometimes a strong compulsion sets this destiny
quietly one side, as in this case. She taught for one year, grew
restive, and shut the school-room door forever behind her.</P>

<P>"Father," she would say, "I am going to do the work I like best of
all to do. I am going to write stories."</P>

<P>And he - the strong, bookish, practical man, would answer:</P>

<P>"Of course you can write. you have only to study the best
literature and persist and you will some day equal Charlotte
Bronte."</P>

<P>This stirred the girl's heart. That strange child of the moors had
been her literary idol, and, indeed, there was always something in
common between the Massachusetts girl and the Bronte sisters.</P>

<P>For her father's judgment she had the greatest reverence. His hope
and faith inspired her. She read, studied and wrote.</P>

<P>It is evidence of the strong originality of her genius, that,
fascinated as she was by these youthful idols, she never became,
consciously or unconsciously, any one's imitator. Her nearest
friends, as well as those more remote, testify that she was, in her
whole nature, distinctly 'sui generis.'</P>

<P>It followed then that she must do her work in her own way, and she
did so.</P>

<P>It was Mr. Moses Dow, of the Waverly Magazine, who first welcomed
Maria Louise Pool's stories published when she was about sixteen,
recognized her talent, praised and encouraged her, and sent her the
Waverly, so that she could not only enjoy that supreme delight of all
young writers - the seeing her work in print - but could measure
herself with the many other girlish aspirants for fame. he also sent
her the current issues of the Atlantic and Harper's Monthly, which
were now making a distinct impression upon our literature.</P>

<P>Even in these early days Miss Pool's work was free from vapid
sentiment and sentimentalism. They were always strong stories, and
they were written with a certain intensity of tone which was quite
unaffected and a part of the writer's personality. A temperamental
likeness runs through all her work, early and late. It is this which
has laid her open to criticism as a writer of melodrama, - a
criticism, as her friends believe, wholly unjust if it is intended to
imply that there was ever any conscious straining after effect, or
any premeditated extravagance.</P>

<P>This intense tone is, I repeat, temperamental and could only have
been eliminated by essentially modifying her whole nature and making
her quite other than what she was.</P>

<P>Happily, an opulent sense of humor and a tender appreciation of
the pathos in so many sodden and dreary human lives, came, as a later
development, to relax the tense strain of feeling under which she
wrote.</P>

<P>Time has broadened, mellowed, chastened and spiritualized her
work. This is apparent in her later stories, notably the "Red Bridge
Neighborhood," where the awful realism of the misers' lives is
softened to the esthetic sense by the exquisite rendering of Olive
Nawn's lovely nature.</P>

<P>There is a clamorous demand just now for nature, for the human
being as she is, stripped of all conventional disguises. "All life,"
says Zangwill, "is melodrama." The nearer we get to elemental man the
more we shall realize it.</P>

<P>This young girl, however, never wore her heart upon her sleeve.
She was too essentially a Puritan to do that. There was always about
her a palpable reserve. Only by a glance, a gleam of the eye, a
fleeting expression of contenance, would you have guessed that fire
smouldered under the snow. it blazed on her written pages, but
nowhere else.</P>

<P>As she passed into the early twenties and beyond, she was living
her life in the way that suited her best. She was busy with her pen
and earning enough by its use for her wants, gaining here and there a
congenial friend, doing a good deal of innocent hero-worship, making
acquaintance with what was the best in literature, in close touch
with the city that was to the end of her life the city of her heart,
where she studied pictures and music and the drama and human life
with keenest relish.</P>

<P>It was somewhere in these years that I met her for the first time,
and now clearly recall the vivid and strong impression she made upon
me.</P>

<P>A girl somewhat frail, but alive to the tips of her fingers,
slender, blonde, simply dressed with a certain austerity of style,
chafing under the restraint of imperfect health but owning a spirit
indomitable, unique, subservient to nobody's opinions, independent,
yet gentle, pure-minded, high-souled, - a Puritan maiden, who drew in
with her first breath that spiritual ozone, which makes itself felt
like an electric force in the best types of all those hardy people
dwelling along the shores of the historic Bay.</P>

<P>It was not far from this time that she met the friend who was so
much to her the rest of her life. I hesitate to touch upon so
personal a matter, so impossible does it seem to adequately
characterize it. Yet it must by no means be omitted from a paper
which aims to gather in review all the agencies which went toward the
making of her life, which made possible all which she
accomplished.</P>

<P>Most friendships are only incidents, more or less pleasing. But
this friendship which now came to Miss Pool in the person of a woman
whose nature seemed the exact and perfect complement of her own, was,
I can truly say, a most important factor in her life. It satisfied
her heart-need of loving, and filled her life with that perennial
glory that only a full affection can know. It gave her an exhaustless
sympathy, a true appreciation, a mentor whose criticism she valued, a
companion whose society was a perpetual delight. This friendship was
a strength and support through all the vicissitudes of thirty-two
full years. Few have deserved as much from friendship and few have
received so much.</P>

<P>This was an eventful period in Miss Pool's life. Her literary
field was widening. The first high-class Magazine to recognize her
was the Galaxy, to which she contributed many telling stories.</P>

<P>She removed to Brooklyn in 1870, and spent there seven growing and
fruitful years. During this time she made her first visit to
Virigina, and the charm of the South left a deep and indelible
impression upon her sensitive nature.</P>

<P>In 1877 she returned to Massachusetts, and the two friends settled
on a farm in the old and picturesque town of Wrentham, the early home
of her friend. There they lived for fifteen years. It was a quaint
old house that sheltered them. Out of it had gone a sturdy, cultured
band of men and women. It had been a station on the underground
railroad, and had entertained such men as Garrison, Phillips, George
Thompson, and Frederick Douglass.</P>

<P>This farm was the home of the saddle pony, Thimble; Floss, who was
not a "woman's horse," and Rab, the Gordon setter, whose happiest
hours were spent in loping through the fields and woods with Thimble
and his mistress.</P>

<P>"I have never been able," she wrote, "to conquer my longing for
one of the small Yorkshire terriers." Orlando of "The Dyke Shanty"
was this small Yorkshire, to whom Miss Pool dedicated her book, "Boss
and Other Dogs." The story of Orlando's swift and cruel death she
could never hear recapitulated in her presence.</P>

<P>Sandro and Gypsey, two Yorkshires, and the little King Charles,
and the friend are now living at the old homestead - caring for the
aged mother who is left a widow and childless.</P>

<P>Miss Pool's love for animals, dogs especially, is apparent in all
her writings.</P>

<P>In nearly all of her stories a dog is one of the 'dramatis
personoe,' and he is as distinctly individualized as the human
characters; but it is in her special stories about dogs that the
pathetic intimacy of these humble lives with our own is most
touchingly suggested. I do not envy the person who can read "Boss,"
"Willers," of "Me 'n' Maje," without emotion.</P>

<P>Miss Pool had a natural and hearty love for the children of her
brain which she unaffectedly confessed. Of all her books, "Boss and
Other Dogs," lay nearest her heart.</P>

<P>It was some time in the early part of the next decade, while the
farm-house was still her home, that she found her special vocation as
a delineator of New England life. The "Ransom Sketches" appeared in
the New York Tribune and soon won an appreciative audience which
widened and grew enthusiastic as her work in this field grew stronger
and better.</P>

<P>'Genre' pictures are never pleasing to those who sit for them. We
cannot see how utterly commonplace and uninteresting we should be if
the charming oddity of speech, the curious trick of accent, the
quaint thought quaintly set in our quaint vernacular were translated
into conventional speech. The artist sees all these things, and sees
them because he is so truly in sympathy with us.</P>

<P>No one ever lived who loved her people with a more passionate
affection than Maria Louise Pool. Her delicious humor played about
them to illuminate, not to consume. Her insight was as tender and
sympathetic as it was keen, and it is plain that the pathos in many
of these starved lives touched her too deeply for tears.</P>

<P>Her characters are not monstrosities, not exceptions even; they
are carefully drawn, sympathetically reproduced - specimens of the
men and women familiar to her from childhood. No town has a monopoly
of the originals, no section is destitute of them. If sometimes it is
needful to paint the disagreeable side, to give shadow to the lights
in the picture, it is as wholesome to life as it is necessary to art.
The Puritan has his hard side, his unlovely limitations, his hateful
asceticism, his intolerance, his greed, but he keeps always that
strong individual tang which makes him a pungent companion and a most
interesting subject of study.</P>

<P>The light sketches of summer travel gathered in the little volume,
"A Vacation in a Buggy," belong to this period, and this was her
first introduction to the public as a book-maker.</P>

<P><A HREF="pool/tenting1.html">"Tenting at Stony Beach"</A> followed
next.</P>

<P>She made a second visit to Florida this winter, tarrying on her
return for a few weeks in the North Carolina mountains near
Asheville. Out of this visit grew "Dally," and "Against Human Nature"
- the local coloring in the latter being so strong that it is hard to
believe that a single visit made so deep and powerful an impression.
The story of this time was also told in a series of letters to the
New York Tribune, some of which were afterward collected in the
volume, "In Buncombe County."</P>

<P>The careless, picturesque, sunshine-steeped atmosphere of the
South is in all these stories and sketches. But the Puritan spirit of
the writer is never quite lost under the glamour, and her perception
of the shiftlessness of the country is amusingly obvious.</P>

<P>Until the publication of "Dally" Miss Pool had written no set love
story, though a thread of sentiment ran through many of her
sketches.</P>

<P>After "Dally" came <A HREF="poolstory.html">"Roweny in
Boston,"</A> followed by its sequel, "Mrs. Keats Bradford." Then came
"Katharine North," one of her most delightful books, and later, "The
Two Salomes," succeeded soon by its sequel, "Out of Step."</P>

<P>Her reputation as a novelist was now established and her audience
widened with each publication. Her industry was prodigious. Hardly
had she dismissed one set of characters with their history than her
busy, fertile brain was entertaining another company.</P>

<P>The plot is often of the slenderest, but the commonplace incidents
that develop it are so finely and truly related, the wit, humor and
pathos are so charming, that the reader follows along the track of
the story fascinated and absorbed.</P>

<P>As she worked on, the knowledge came to her from time to time
that, near and far, a host of admirers watched for and welcomed her.
Letters poured in upon her, and warmed her heart and stimulated her
pen. She liked intelligent criticism and generous praise when
sincere, but she abhorred flattery, and always feared that her
friends were biased in their judgment of her work. She was never
satisfied with present achievement, but constantly longed to
advance.</P>

<P>"Full of pathos, full of humor and full of human nature," quoted a
friend from the criticism of Katharine North. "What more would you
have?"</P>

<P>"I have a teasing desire to do it better," she quietly
replied.</P>

<P>She always regretted, in herself, the absence of what she
recognized as style in others. But, if she had not this, she had
something better and rarer. There was something wonderfully telling
and true in her touch, - direct, incisive, clear as crystal, strong
as iron.</P>

<P>Some of these stories have in them an immortal quality. Take "Me
'n' Maje," for example. The canvas is small, there is no background,
no accessories to give light and color, the figures are few - an
overworked Yankee woman, a toothless cripple, and an ordinary yellow
dog, - but the tender emotions of life, the glory of faithful love
illuminates the picture.</P>

<P>When the mood served she was the most amusing of companions,
revelling in the grotesquerie of extravagance till her friends cried
for mercy.</P>

<P>She was an intelligent conversationalist, but never a voluble
talker. In her letters she was delightful, bright, original,
charming, leaving one with the impression of having met her face to
face.</P>

<P>She was free from all those small social tricks of smile or laugh
or voice or phrase which so many women affect.</P>

<P>Life was to her rich and beautiful. No one ever enjoyed it more,
yet the thought of the possible sorrow that comes with great loving
and the awful unknown lying behind the smiling mask of everyday, was
never far from her.</P>

<P>"What a mystery it all is!" she said often.</P>

<P>Her religion was without dogma. She found a home in any church
where the love of goodness was the inspiration. She was a woman
suffragist in principle and a friend to all wise reforms, although
she never espoused any of them publicly, feeling, no doubt, that the
good she was able to do must be done in her own way. She had a
peculiar, nervous organization, and her work exacted a degree of
concentration as well as a degree of quiet and seclusion which was
incompatible with many things that might otherwise have been most
pleasant.</P>

<P>She shrank from all that was gruesome and ghostly. She liked the
sunshine and hid away from the noisome realities of this mysterious
world - from the awful seeming of Death. When she went down into the
shadow she went all unknowing, and so unfearing.</P>

<P>For society in the usual sense she had no vocation; as a spectacle
it amused and interested her. <IMG SRC="images/poolhouse3.gif" WIDTH=298 HEIGHT=218 ALIGN=left></P>

<P>The happy years were drawing toward the close. In 1894 the two
friends moved to Rockland, and Miss Pool took up her life again where
she began it. Her mother's advanced age and her sister's declining
health made this change seem necessary, and though it involved
sacrifice, the daughter, who had always been generous and devoted,
did not hesitate to make the change. An new house was built, and the
two friends became close neighbors to the household in the old
home.</P>

<P>In the new home the old work went on - her den overlooking the old
house, the pictures of the dogs upon the walls, the plain table with
the dictionary and the manuscript drawer, the desk by the window, the
lounge in the corner, and Stuart, - the little King Charles, - curled
upon a pillow, have all been described.</P>

<P>Out of this room went to the publishers "Mrs. Gerald," a strong
story. Then came "In the First Person," "Boss and Other Dogs," "In a
Dyke Shanty," "The Red Bridge Neighborhood," "A Golden Sorrow,"
"Friendship and Folly," and "The Maloon Farm" - completed and in the
hands of the publisher just before her fatal illness. All these show
a distinct advance in power, and place their author among those who
have written immortal works. Until one reads "The Maloon Farm," - a
sequel to "In the First Person," - one must say that in the "Red
Bridge Neighborhood" her genius reached its high-water mark.</P>

<P>"A Golden Sorrow" had been partly written and published, when the
magazine in which it appeared suspended publication. It was finished,
however, in spite of this disappointment, and it has since been put
into book form.</P>

<P>Her last year was clouded with care, anxiety and sorrow, and in
January occurred the death of her sister Amelia. Spring came on. Much
that was beloved and beautiful was still left. Her work was in
demand. It was winning praises. A brilliant reputation awaited her.
The goal was in sight.</P>

<P>But that which must come was coming. Did its dark shadow reach
forward and touch with palsying finger the bright hopes of those busy
spring days?</P>

<P>"Dear C-----," she said, so many times in those weeks, "I am so
happy I am afraid!" <IMG SRC="images/poolgrave2.gif" ALT="Picture of Pool- Branson grave" WIDTH=222 HEIGHT=220 ALIGN=right></P>

<P>She was suddenly stricken with pneumonia and dies May 19,
1898.</P>

<P>Published as an Introduction to "A Widower &amp; Some Spinsters -
Short Stories by Maria Louise Pool" by Herbert S. Stone &amp; Co.,
New York and Chicago, 1899, and edited by C.M.B.</P>

<P>In the Rockland newspaper, among the survivors of Maria Louise
Pool is named Caroline M. Branson, her "literary companion."</P>

<P>Maria Louise Pool and Caroline M. Branson are buried together in
Mt. Pleasant Cemetery in Rockland, Massachusetts. Their house still
stands on Liberty Street in Rockland, near the corner of East Water
Street, and next to the 1770's cape where she was born. A Boston
School portrait of Maria Louise Pool hangs in Rockland's Memorial
Library.
