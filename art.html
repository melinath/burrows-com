<H2><CENTER>ART AND WORKMANSHIP</CENTER></H2>

<H4><CENTER>W. R. LETHABY</CENTER></H4>

<P>We have been in the habit of writing so lyrically of art and of
the temperament of the artist that the average man who lives in the
street, sometimes a very mean street, is likely to think of it as
remote and luxurious, not "for the likes of him." There is the danger
in habitual excess of language that the plain man is likely to be
frightened by it. It may be feared that much current exposition of
the place and purpose of art only widens the gap between it and
common lives.</P>

<P>A proper function of criticism should be to foster our national
arts and not to frighten timid people off with high-pitched
definitions and far-fetched metaphors mixed with a flood of (as
Morris said) "sham technical twaddle." It is a pity to make a mystery
of what should most easily be understood. there is nothing occult
about the thought that all things may be made well or made ill. A
work of art is a well-made thing, that is all. It may be a well-made
statue or a well-made chair, or a well-made book. Art is not a
special sauce applied to ordinary cooking; it is the cooking itself
if it is good. Most simply and generally art may be thought of as THE
WELL-DOING OF WHAT NEEDS DOING. If the thing is not worth doing it
can hardly be a work of art, however well it may be done. A thing
worth doing which is ill done is hardly a thing at all.</P>

<P>Fortunately people are artists who know it not - bootmakers (the
few left), gardeners and basketmakers, and all players of games. We
do not allow shoddy in cricket or football, but reserve it for
serious things like houses and books, furniture and funerals.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If it is necessary that everything must be translated into words,
our art critics might occupy quite a useful place if they would be
good enough to realise that behind the picture shows of the moment is
the vast and important art of the country, the arts of the builder,
furniture maker, printer and the rest, which are matters of national
well-being.</P>

<P>It is doubtful if we have it in us to form a leading school of
painting at the present time; indeed, we seem to be occupied in
trying to catch up with Europe at the wrong moment. It cannot be
doubted, however, that we might lead in the domestic arts. And this
is shown by the great interest which foreign observers take in the
English arts and crafts movement. the Germans, indeed, who know the
history of this development in England better than we do ourselves,
realising its importance from an economic point of view, have gone so
far as to constitute a special branch of political economy which
shall deal with the subject. One university, I believe, has
established a professor's chair in the economics of arts and crafts.
English study of fine lettering has in Germany been put into types
which English printers are hastening to buy.</P>

<P>During the last thirty years many English designers have set
themselves to learn the crafts as artists; that is, so that they may
have complete mastery of both design and workmanship. I may remark
here that a characteristic of a work of art is that the design
inter-penetrates workmanship as in a painting, so that one may hardly
know where one ends and the other begins. The master-workman,
further, must have complete control from first to last to shape and
finish as he will. We have now many highly trained men among us who
might make books as notable as those of the finest presses if there
were a steady demand for fine modern work. If I were asked for some
simple test by which we might hope to know a work of art when we saw
one I should suggest something like this: EVERY WORK OF ART SHOWS
THAT IT WAS MADE BY A HUMAN BEING FOR A HUMAN BEING. Art is the
humanity put into workmanship, the rest is slavery. The difference
between a man-made work and a commercially-made work is like the
difference between a gem and paste. We may not be able to tell the
difference at first, but, when we find out, the intrinsic worth of
the one is self-evident. Still it is highly important that commercial
work shall be properly done after its own kind.</P>

<P>Although a machine-made thing can never be a work of art in the
proper sense, there is no reason why it should not be good in a
secondary order - shapely, smooth, strong, well fitting, useful; in
fact, like a machine itself. Machine-work should show quite frankly
that it is the child of the machine; it is the pretence and
subterfuge of most machine-made things which make them
disgusting.</P>

<P>In the reaction from the dull monotony of early Victorian days it
must be admitted that many workers fell into the affectation of
over-designing their things. Rightly understood, "design" is not an
agony of contortion but an effort to arrive at what will be obviously
fit and true. The best design is one which, cost apart, should become
a commonplace. A fine piece of furniture or a fine book-binding
should be shaped as inevitably as a fiddle.</P>

<P>Usually the best method of designing has been to improve on an
existing model by bettering it a point at a time; a perfect table or
chair or book has to be very well bred.</P>

<P>Another phase of the reaction from the modern type has been an
excessive regard for old things, so that original workers have not
had a fair chance of maintaining the full traditions of their arts.
The social results of "collecting old furniture," for instance, of
course were not foreseen, but they certainly inflicted great injury
on an essentially noble craft. At the present moment people who would
like to do things in the best way would be well advised to have what
they require made by capable men in modern forms. Now that we know
all about it there is something pawnshoppy about gatherings from
auctions, and the highly misdirected skill of the imitator has often
made it next to impossible for even the expert to tell the difference
between an original work and a copy.</P>

<P>Of course the scarcity, value and historical interest of old
pictures, and books printed by Caxton, made it inevitable that they
should be sought for and bought at great prices, but undoubtedly such
collecting of antiques has had a most injurious effect on all kinds
of modern production.</P>

<P>Of many problems this one of bringing back art to workmanship is
not the least serious, or the most hopeful. It is a tremendous thing
that whereas a century or so ago the great mass of the people
exercised arts, such as boot-making, book-binding, chair-making,
smithing, and the rest, now a great wedge has been driven in between
the craftsman of every kind and his customers by the method of large
production by machinery. "We cannot go back" - true; and it is as
true that we cannot stay where we are.</P>

<P>Once more let me try to make it clear that by art, instructed
thinkers don't only mean pictures or quaint and curious things, or
necessarily costly ones, certainly not luxurious ones. they mean
worthy and complete workmanship by competent workmen.</P>
