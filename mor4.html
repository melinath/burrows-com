In some cases it may be necessary to disregard the character of the
ceiling entirely, and heighten the walls by painting the cornice like
them. it may equally happen that a gawky room would be much improved
by lessening its apparent height. All that is needed in that case is
a string-moulding at the required depth below the cornice; the space
above this string, or necking, is the frieze, and will be decorated
or not decorated, according as the ceiling is plain or particolored.
If plain, tint the frieze with the same distemper you use for the
ceiling and cornice. If the ceiling be decorated, the frieze should
be as much, or perhaps a little more, decorated; but the difference
should be in greater dignity, rather than elaboration. The decoration
of a frieze, if it leave any pretension at all, should be done by
hand; it requires more careful design than the wall itself, because
nothing but absolute fitness will justify the separation of this part
of the wall for special treatment.</P>

<P>It will be understood from this that Morris and Company do not
print distinctive frieze-patterns. One or other of the simplest
yellow and white, or white-ground, wallpapers, is sometimes used for
the frieze, when tone requires some faint patterning on the ceiling;
but in this case the pattern is altogether subordinate to the tone,
and its color is the chief value. Ceiling-papers we seldom use; but
for the occasions noted above, numbers 101, 18, 107,11, 144, or the
green tints of the sample patterns, are suitable. Those we should use
for friezes in connection with them, are numbers 2,5, 46, 120, 98,
99, 30, 63, 64, and such like. We now come to the wall proper - the
space which our wall-papers, cotton-prints, and damasks are designed
to cover. In choosing the pattern for this, there are some dangers to
be avoided, to which all who are unaccustomed to the selection of
decorative details are liable. In the first place it is difficult,
when a pattern is presented on narrow strips, to know whether the
shapes it will make on the wall are only those that appear, or if
entirely new lines and shapes may not be developed by combination; it
is also difficult to know whether the scale of the pattern is
suitable. In the narrow breadth the pattern is apt to look much
larger than it will on the wall; and from this cause, patterns
miserably inadequate for the decorations of the space they are
intended to fill are too often chosen. You cannot entirely guard
against either danger by having two or three rolls displayed
together; experience will still be wanting. Patterns which take the
fancy when seen in the show-room will be disappointing on the wall,
and you will almost certainly err on the side of smallness or
feebleness in size and tone. This brings us to the great difficulty,
the more serious because quite unsuspected; the risk there always is
in choosing a pattern from simple liking, without consideration of
the place the pattern has to fill. Pattern-choosing, like
pattern-making, is an Architectural Art. A pattern is but a part of
any scheme of decoration, and its value will be derived in great part
from its surroundings. Personal liking, therefore, is not an
infallible guide in the choice of wall-papers.</P>

<P>There are conditions that must be respected if the liking is to
last; and these depend entirely on the character of the room to be
decorated, on the extent of wall-space to be covered, on the amount
and kind of light in the room, on the color of the timber if
so-called "natural woods" are used, and on many details which
practiced eyes only can properly estimate. We recommend, therefore,
that the advice of some one accustomed to the work ought always to be
had; but for ordinary cases the following simple rules may be laid
down, which will perhaps answer most questions. If there is reason
for keeping the wall very quiet, choose a pattern that works all over
without pronounced lines, such as the Diapers, Mallows, Venetians,
Poppy, Scroll, Jasmine, &amp;c., &amp;c.</P>

<P>If you may venture on more decided patterning, and you ought
always to go for positive patterns when they may be had, choose the
Daisy, Trellis, Vine, Chrysanthemum, Lily, Honeysuckle, Larkspur,
Rose, Acanthus, or such. In deciding between those whose direction or
set is horizontal, and those which have more obviously vertical or
oblique lines, you must be guided entirely by the look of the room.
Put very succinctly, architectural effect depends upon a nice balance
of horizontal, vertical, and oblique. No rules can say how much of
each; so nothing can really take the place of feeling and good
judgment. If you have no professional aid, you must decide for
yourself whether the room most wants stability and repose, or if it
is too stiff and formal. If repose be wanted, choose the pattern,
other things also being duly considered, which has horizontal
arrangement of its parts. If too great rigidity be the fault, choose
a pattern with soft, easy lines, either boldly circular or
oblique-wavy, - say Scroll, Vine Pimpernel, Fruit, &amp;c. If the
fault lie in the too great predominance of horizontal lines, without
any marked stiffness in the parts, as when the walls are very low and
long, choose one of the columnar patterns, as Larkspur, Spray, or
Indian; or, better still, hang the walls with chintz, or other cloth,
in folds. If the room has no marked defect, and you have the pleasure
of choosing from a wider range of patterns, do not be afraid of
choosing a large one, provided the tone of it be what you want. if
the light in the room be bright and plentiful, choose from the
fainter colorings. If the light be weak, choose patterns of strong
relief.</P>

<P>As regards color, you will be guided in the first place by the
color of the wood-work, if this be unpainted. The usual pitch-pine,
ash, and hard woods, as they are varnished and finished for interior
fittings, are so undecorative as to make the task of fitting
wall-papers to them very difficult. If the wood be walnut or
dark-stained oak, the papers with metallic grounds will be best, or
the darkest many-colored papers, like dark trellis. If the color of
the timber be lighter and yellowish, you must choose from the olive
or sage-green papers, and prefer the fullest and richest in pattern
to the plainer ones. If the timber be nicely designed and finished,
one of the stuffs already mentioned would be more suitable than
wall-papers, unless the gold grounds be excepted; but these cases do
not come under the ordinary class, and need special treatment.</P>

<P>Keeping then to rooms that may be described generally, we will
notice next those which have painted doors, windows, and other
fittings. In these rooms it is often allowable to determine the color
at pleasure; still, some things cannot be disregarded. Should the
character of the wood-work be what is called bold, - that is,
coarsely, moulded, and neither nice in proportion nor style, you
would do better to paint it of a dark shade than a light one; and
that will influence the choice of wall-paper. Some patterns called
light will go very well with paint decidedly dark, - as for instance
Daisy 75, or Venetian 74, with dark-green paint. Usually, if the
paint be dark, the paper is chosen of nearly the same tone. There is
no great reason for this. Rooms with wood-work and walls of equal
tone are sometimes very tame, and even dull. It is better to make the
wood-work either darker or lighter than the walls.</P>

<P>In the choice of color there is scarcely any help to be given
except with the paint and brush. the best thing to say is that, when
all is done, the result must be color, not colors. If there are
curtains or carpet or other finishings to be worked up to, you must
consider which of them, if any, shall be the predominating color, and
the carpet the secondary. The curtains will then either blend with
the walls, and help to surround the carpet with a frame of color
contrasting with it generally, but not necessarily with a strong
contrast, or the curtains, or the curtains may be used to harmonize
the carpet with the walls. The choice must depend upon the kind of
room and the point of departure. Should you be quite untrammelled,
you may prefer to select the carpet first, and then the wall-paper
and color of the wood-work; but having determined the predominant
color, the subservient colors must be so balanced as to soften it by
variations or brighten it by contrast. Contrasting color, if strong,
must be kept within small quantities; if pale or gray, it may be more
freely used. Chairs and sofas give great opportunitites for
introducing points of bright contrasting color, and for those high
lights and darkest shades which are essential in a complete scheme.
Covers need not be uniform. They may be of two or three or four
kinds, according to the size of the room and number of pieces.</P>

<P>If the chief color be red, it will be desireable to have a large
area of white for rest to the eye. Blues, gray, green, and lighter
tints of red should be the variants. Contrast with it should be
generally avoided; it wants rather quiet than excitement. Whenever
white paint may be used for the wood-work, choose it in preference to
any other. The use of positive color is very difficult, and
house-painters are peculiarly ignorant of it. Their incapacity may
have led to the use of the dull, gray, even dirty shades, which have
become so general since house-decoration has begun to interest
educated people. The revolt against crude, inharmonious coloring has
pushed things to the opposite extreme, and instead of over-bright
colors, we have now dirty no-colors. The aim was to get sobriety and
tenderness, but the inherent difficulty was not less great than
before. It is not more easy to paint grays that shall have color,
than to paint color that shall be gray; and whichever it be, color is
still the essential. in this difficulty the use of white paint is the
only way of safety. White is perfectly neutral; it is a perfect foil
to most colors, and by judicious toning may be assimilated with any.
it is, therefore, manageable without real art. When used in its
highest tone, direct the painter to put no mixture of black or blue
to the natural pigment, whether lead or zinc. If a little degradation
be needed, use orange-chrome and green, either alone or together. Do
not use black, and very rarely raw-umber.</P>

<P>Very few questions remain. If you ask whether the color of the
wood-work ought as a rule to be lighter or darker than that of the
paper, the answer is, There is no rule. White or light-tones paints
may be used if the wood-work is well designed and nicely finished, -
that is, if the shapes are agreeable and the surface pleasant. If the
shapes be not bad, but the moulding be heavy and coarse, it is better
to make the wood-work darker than the wall. If the shapes be bad, -
too many and too irregular, - the ugliness will be reduced by
painting pretty closely to the tone of the paper; and when this is
necessary, choose for the wall the richest and most interesting
design the room will bear, - to avoid the fault of dullness, which
might otherwise attend the use of a non-contrasting paint. When your
room is already well designed and has nice detail, you can use much
more liberty in the choice of wall-paper and paint.</P>
