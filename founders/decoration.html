<CENTER><B>SOME PRINCIPLES OF DECORATION</B></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">I</FONT>NDIVIDUAL taste-or the lack of it-in
arrangement and decoration has made no very decided movement of any
kind for some considerable time past. Matters remain, in the mass,
much as they were; the intelligent upholsterer who receives carte
blanche from affluent patrons still adds, "to make the place look
homely," his finishing touches in the shape of scattered volumes that
bear the seal and superscription of Mudie; the no less intelligent
amateur still pursues the uneven tenor of her way, mingling foul with
fair, heaping together objects which-well enough in
themselves-disparage and nullify each the other's charms when forced
into companionship; lighting, by chance medley, now and again, on a
pleasing harmony, but more often failing to achieve aught but
incoherency and fatuity of effect.</P>

<P>There are exceptions, of course, and these do but the more
emphatically prove the rule. And the reason of this inconsistency,
this inability to grasp the situation as a whole, this predominance
of zeal over discrimination in the large majority is not far to seek;
it arises in part from the widespread superstition that the sense of
sight needs no education; partly from the influence of fashion; and
partly, also, from the fact that the true flair for decorative beauty
is almost as rare as the gift of divination, or the power of
abstention from verse-writing. He of antique anecdotal fame, who, on
being asked as to whether he could play the violin, responded
genially that he did not know because he had never tried, was
diffidence incarnated by comparison with most of those who furnish
houses. The judicious choice of a wallpaper, the right selection and
disposal of furniture, is taken for granted as being thrown in with
the rest of the feminine arts; the housewife who is dissatisfied with
her own arrangement of her own drawing-room, or who entertains
misgivings as to her heaven-born ability for grouping flowers to the
best advantage, were hard, indeed, to find.</P>

<P>And yet each of these accomplishments is a separate science in
itself, and-though capable of modification to suit with individual
predilections and whimsies-founded on principles as well-defined as
those that govern the composition of a sonnet, a picture, or a fugue.
Each has its own more or less subtle laws of being, its own code of
transgressions and gamut of merits. There is, of course, nothing
positively wrong in taking delight in uncomely, or even hideous,
surroundings; many estimable and talented persons have passed through
life unconscious, and uncareful, of their singularly ugly material
environment. Some of the most illustrious writers of to-day inhabit
rooms and houses that, decoratively speaking, are a slur upon
civilization. And this merely from the absence of development in one
particular direction. Yet there lies a certain unexplained. and,
perhaps, inexplicable mystery in the established fact that one who
can, and does, both appreciate and translate into fitting words the
best glories of the best sort of sunset, or of a cherry tree in
blossom, will spend, year in, year out, the main portion of his time
in company with goods and chattels that are positively detestable,
within the shelter of walls so bedizened as to be in open revolt
against all accepted principles of beauty.</P>

<P>"There are," observes the hero of a clever Transatlantic novel,
"some things as can be altered, and others as can't-let's alter them
as can," and the saying is not without its modicum of wisdom.
Ourselves, whom time and care and sickness seem all joined in a
conspiracy to disfigure, it were vain to consider from any standpoint
of comeliness; we are, for the more part, "not fair to outward view;"
neither, as it very frequently' happens, are the features,
topographical or architectural, of our immediate neighbourhood. These
are things out of our control that cannot well be altered, and
perhaps are no great matter after all. But with indoor decoration it
is altogether otherwise; you can make what you will of the house you
live in, either a mere shelter from the weather, a box of brick or
stone, where you eat and sleep and pass your days in as much material
ease as you can compass; or, on the other hand, a refuge that may be
even as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land, an oasis of
infinite peace and suggestion, a place that pleases and satisfies
both eye and intellect at once.</P>

<P>It is best, for obvious reasons, to have some definite scheme of
decoration from the outset: to determine firmly as to which path you
shall follow. To put it broadly, ignoring all minor complexities of
grade and detail, there are two distinct and different ways of
constructing the House Beautiful: the one plan is pitched on a high
plane of austerity, and demands no little courage, sacrifice, and
repression; the other, of homelier complexion-and, it may be, of more
lasting charm-is replete with rich colours and low tones: it allows a
wider scope for personal idiosyncrasies, is more catholic, and, on
the whole, much easier to live with.</P>

<P>Should the inspiration of the moment dictate to you a command for
walls light in colour, you must not, having once put your hand to the
plough, entertain any idea of looking back. That would be to ruin
all. A fastidious chastity of form and site must be the order of the
day; your pieces of furniture, very refined, very fit, and very few,
are to be disposed here and there after anxious premeditation and
earnest thought. They must correspond in their design with the spirit
of the wall-papers, or the panelling, and be placed just there (and
in no other position than that) where they will tell the most
effectively as patches of a darker tone; or you may choose to set the
whole walls, chairs, tables, and all-in a high key; only remembering
that if this be done you must keep just as tight a rein over your
fancy as though the plenishing were of dark wood. A severe elegance,
scrupulously maintained and consistently carried out in every
particular, is the main characteristic of this method; the colour
chord, limited though it be, will have an austere sweetness that
falls in well with some temperaments, but a jarring note were
disastrous.</P>

<P>It will be something in the nature of a domestic tyranny that you
thus establish. Are you a collector, you cannot bring home a new
vase, a picture, a fresh acquisition of any sort that promises the
remotest chance of upsetting the reigning scheme. A book with a gay
cover, a time-table, a newspaper, a magazine, each and all of these
blameless commodities might create a revolution in this little world,
where things go wrong so easily. A displaced chair or table, a settee
drawn up to the hearth, away from its accustomed niche, would work
havoc on the general effect, which, to be sure, seeing that it is so
easily disturbed, may not be altogether worth the sacrifices it
demands. It is possible to tire of pedantic perfection, even in
decorative art, such as many an elegant First Empire scheme aspired
to, and to sigh for something touched with less asceticism and a
broader proportion of comfort. With low-toned walls and ceilings all
things are possible; it is not only less difficult to make a room
thus arrayed look well, but there is also small doubt as to which
result, when completed, is more to be preferred.</P>

<P>A rich, deep-hued background (always provided it be good in
colour), besides its soothing composure, offers unquestionable
advantages; it is becoming in the extreme to every objets that may be
placed against it, whether human or the work of the cabinet-maker, as
any who has noticed a group of figures beside a hedge of clipped yew
or flex can bear witness. There is no merciless silhouetting, no
hard-and-fast definition; now and again the outline is lost and
intermingled in a pleasant dusk, that nevertheless has nothing of
gloom, because the colours, though sombre, are pure and mellow, and
the design, what you may see of it, graceful, and compacted of
well-chosen forms. Again, your low-toned background gives a so much
ampler scope for variety and quantity in the furniture whose
attractions it is to enhance; a light-coloured chamber must, as we
have said, be sparsely and warily plenished, while in the former
case, so long as over-crowding is avoided, it is possible, and even
desirable, to be generous.</P>

<P>Few errors are commoner and more likely to engender a quick and
lively sense of remorse than the careless or over-hasty choice of
wallcoverings; and yet, while the most earnest consideration is
frequently bestowed upon the selection of a gown, the purchase of a
dog, the entering upon a betrothal-all matters of importance in their
way -scarce a tithe of such deliberation is given by the large
majority to the inner development of the houses in which they are to
live and move and have their being. Generally speaking, the person
about to " decorate " a fresh abode is the sport of chance, of any
random impulse or ephemeral fad. Blown by every wind of doctrine, a
prey to conflicting passions for various modes and periods, the
amateur whom undisciplined decorative predilections lions have
hurried astray has much, and often, to regret. Should you stoop to
such folly -your walls are sure to bear mute witness against - you
from your rising up to your down-lying.</P>

<P>"Sleepless with cold, commemorative eyes," the peacock frieze in
unblessed union with the realistic flowery wall-paper stares mute
reproach at you so long as it, and you, may endure. If you can afford
to do so, you will, after a certain while - fluctuating according to
individual temperament - and the exigencies of the moment-send for
the workmen to arise and unbuild it again; but if, on the other hand,
you are lacking in means, or in - Napoleonic decision, there is
nothing for it but to "bulge along" like Brer Rabbit, and bear the
consequences as best you may. Your albatross will hang heavy round
your neck; and all the heavier that it was your own crossbow that
burdened you with the unlovely fardel.</P>

<P>The writhing, bastard-Renaissance design that charmed so unwisely
with its morbid tones and affected repeats, loses by custom and
exhibition in the mass those artificial graces wherewith it ensnared
you. Even some of the really fine conventionalizations of flowers, if
too self-assertive and elaborate, fail signally to fulfil the first
law of their being-that of providing an adequate and fitting
background to furniture, pictures, faces, to all, in fine, that a
room may contain. There is hardly a sin in the decorative calender of
crime that were impossible to an ill-conceived or foolishly designed
wall-paper. And the "new-invented game" can rove, perhaps, still more
hopelessly off the rails, it can be played in even more detestably
vicious taste, than the early Victorian.</P>

<P>The tawdry-and, not so very long since, inevitable-white and gold
atrocity which once reduced every respectable drawing-room to the
decorative level of a painted sepulchre; the red or green, flock,
stuffy and depressing as the rep curtains draped against it, that
disfigured the average dining-room; the blowsy, brightly-coloured and
yet dismal-looking floral papers that made our sleeping-chambers as
so many howling wildernesses -they have gone red-handed to their last
account with all their sins unshriven, and thus have merely met with
their deserts; and yet-and yet-were they so very much more
condemnable than many an "art" wall-paper that is the apple of its
owner's eye to-day? In all honesty-no. For there is nothing quite so
repulsive as the degradation of a fine tradition, the garbled version
of something that has once been good; just as an ape is displeasing
in its horrid likeness to a man; precisely as a cast from an out-worn
mould caricatures the beauties of the classic features it was meant
to emulate; even as the mincing modern poetaster of "the pap and
daisy school" (as Mr. Hardy has it) almost makes you turn for the
moment with revulsion from Keats and Herrick: in like manner the
pitiful pasticcios of fitly and decoratively conventionalized forms,
and sombrely harmonized chords of colour; throw a sort of temporary
discredit upon their estimable models.</P>

<P>Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery; it is often, none
the less, the most disgusting; as witness the debased outlines, the
muddy tints, that go to make up many and many a popular wallpaper.
Unhappily, the same movement that dethroned the bloated commonplaces
of the day before yesterday has given birth to more monstrosities.
human and inanimate, than you may care to count. The decadent, the
"art-square," the symbolist, the hand-painted looking-glass,
bedizened by distorted simulacra of iris and Mary-lily; the "art"
colours which simulate the hues of corruption, the "art" wall-paper
with its misbegotten sunflowers and poppies, its inane sham-mediaeval
dicky-birds intermixed with geometrical patternings, its livid
complexion, now sour, now sallow, but ever revolting, they are all in
the same tale. To be sure, they have mainly ebbed out to the suburbs,
but that is only so much the worse for the suburbs, and for the
Aesthetic development of the myriads of admirable persons who reside
therein. It is to be hoped, and expected, that the next turn of the
wheel may disperse the whole sorry company to their own place-the
more or less decent obscurity of minor anthologies and cheap
lodging-houses.</P>

<P>And; if the imitation be vile, it must be confessed that the
original owns certain aspects that are not entirely and invariably
delightful. That school of mural decoration for which the designs of
Mr. William Morris may be taken as the leading type, falls, despite
its obvious (sometimes a little too obvious) virtues, into the common
error of considering wall-paper as an independent system of
decoration in itself, instead of as a portion of the general scheme,
a background, as we have just said, for the contents of the chamber
whose nakedness it is to cover. Now, if you elect to remain satisfied
with your wall-paper as the sole adornment for your walls, then you
can hardly do better than make a choice among the many excellent
examples proffered. And of these there is a multiplicity; indeed it
would almost seem as though the art of designing wall-papers had
reached its highest development It is, nevertheless, in all true
essentials, a superfluity; you "wonder what it was begun for." To
heap pattern on pattern, design over design, were too crass an error
for serious criticism; and this is precisely the transgression into
which the elaborate fascinations of these pretty papers seek to lure
you.</P>

<P>If for their sake you are content to forego the pleasures of
decorating your rooms with pictures and china-both of which
commodities, to be of any worth at all, must appeal to your senses
primarily as patterns-why then, well and good; procure the design
that happens to be most to your taste, and settle down to enjoy it;
only remembering that having once enthroned so elaborate a work of
art, it will brook no rival near. To hang pictures or ornaments of
any kind upon it were to discredit both, and to establish a
contention for supremacy as undecorative as undesirable. And surely,
no wall-paper, however good, can be good enough to compensate for the
banishment of its betters; the very character of it, the material,
its position in the scheme of things decorative, forbid that it
should suffice alone; and therefore the most worthy are the most
unobtrusive. They may be as rich as you please-the gold (ranging from
palest gilt to copper) Japanese leather paper gives proof enough of
that; but simplicity, and that not the bold, bleak, self-conscious
archaism that passes muster so often in its stead, but true
simplicity, chaste, sober, and dignified, must still remain, as in so
much else, the basis of being, the foundation for all the other
virtues.</P>

<P>And to attain to this perfection of simplicity demands an even
subtler skill than does the weaving of an intricate device and
solving the problem of repetition. You must have courage, but not
fool- hardiness, a very fine sense of selection and space, and a
fixed indifference as to whether you shall make a spoon or spoil a
horn. The over-excitable, or impatient designer runs a fair chance of
spoiling all he touches. Fine stripes, placed close together at
regular intervals, with corresponding blank spaces left between, are
capable of much that is good; so is a warm, purely-coloured ground
powdered with conventional shapes. An excellent example of the latter
is a rich Venetian-red paper besprent with dim golden lions, rampant,
heraldic, but unassertive in the extreme for all that. Again, it is
pleasant to see that some delightful designs of the early years of
this century are being revived-dainty arrangements of flowers,
stripes, and ribbons, unambitious, eminently unpictiorial, and
absolutely charming as backgrounds in their appropriate rooms.</P>

<P>Brown paper should be the prop and stay of the economical, and,
indeed, failing the two ideal wallcoverings-panelling and
tapestry-there are few better than this friend in need, if
sympathetically seconded by a really good frieze and well-moulded
picture-rail.</P>

<P>Every now and again (but fortunately seldom) you are brought to
realize fully and newly the great decorative darkness from which the
taste of to-day, for all its faults and excrescences, is gradually
emerging; or, as it might be more accurately said, reverting-turning
backward to simpler schemes and finer principles. You may chance upon
a beautiful old Georgian house infested by latter-day Vandals who
have not hesitated-nay, who have even delighted-to dishonour its
comfortable stateliness with the ordinary trophies of travel,
immoderately disfiguring the walls and the floors of it with stuffed
beasts and hides, with debased Japanese grotesques, common
Chinoiseries, ill-selected spoils of all sorts from the East,
representative of everything that is tiresome and obvious in Oriental
decoration.</P>

<P>This is a comparatively recent vice; yet hardly less significant
than yesterday's hunger and thirst after unrighteousness in another
form, that desperate endeavour to achieve a meretricious elegance of
effect; and proof of that aspiration, again, is brought home to you
afresh, so vividly sometimes as almost to take your breath away for
the moment, by the chilly hand-painted saloons still surviving in no
small number, both in and around London. Occasionally, it is only
fair to confess, these are the despair and the disgust of their
unconsenting occupants, such as may be restrained from destroying
mural ornament that has cost so much, and is still in such an
excellent state of preservation; while to others who incline towards
the hand-painting habit themselves, they are still a shameful
joy.</P>

<P>Some thirty years ago it was that our shores and our homes were
generally invaded by the horde of enterprising aliens, who conceived
the idea of decorating the English drawing-room, then stolidly
complacent in its white and golden glories, with sham Renaissance
devices-of showing the British householder how the lilies grow on the
banks of Italy. Like the "winsome, grinsome grinder" celebrated in
modern verse, these compatriots of his would seem to have been
endowed with- fine powers of persuasion, if you are to judge, that
is, by the number of drawing-rooms, suburban and otherwise, within
individual ken, where painted baskets of blowsy artificial flowers,
meaningless tangles of pink and sky-blue ribbons, obese and
anatomically impossible Amorini, disport themselves for ever upon a
background much the proverbial colour of London milk. But it is not
often that an old house has been thus attacked; the malady is more
generally confined to the usual I folding-doored front and back;
drawing-room so I dear to the early Victorian architect.</P>

<P>For those who are empowered to choose the very best, without let
or hindrance, and who have the wit to choose aright, there are three
alternatives, each equally desirable in its way-wood-panelling, old
tapestry, and old Spanish or Italian leather, the last being somewhat
hard to come by. And of these three wall coverings perhaps the
panelling is most to be preferred. Some are so favoured of fortune as
to inhabit houses already lined with it from ground-floor to garret,
and they are blest indeed; for, painted or polished-but more
especially the latter-it forms a faultless background, composed,
dignified, and reposeful as heart could wish. If it have not the
fantastic suggestiveness of tapestry, it is yet instinct with a
poetry of its own, a grave and quiet charm which is the essence of
decorative content. The gold and black lacquer screen, with its
"pomegranate trees and things," its strange birds, its mysterious
populace; the tall bureau of amboyna wood, inlaid with urn and shell;
the slender, flower-garlanded satinwood table, the gilt-handled,
marble-topped chest of drawers, spreading its sleek sides and
swaggering in portly elegance-what better setting might be hoped for
these, and such as these, than the dark mirror of polished oak, here
giving back a dim reflection so much more beautiful, as all
reflections are, than that of mirrors-there appearing as a twilight
country of infinite possibilities?</P>

<P>And what, indeed, that is in any way good may not benefit by such
a background, independently of period or style? Blue china is never
seen to such perfect advantage as on this vague relief, too glossy
and rich in tone to be sombre, too atmospheric for hardness; while on
low-toned pictures -ever the easiest to live with-you could scarce
bestow a better neighbourhood. A great deal of modern panelling is
well-proportioned and does honour to modern craftsmanship; but to ask
more of it (unless painted) were manifestly unfair; the graces of eld
are of necessity denied it. No artificial method of staining can be
anything but a blunder and a shame; no new mouldings, reedings, or
bevellings can show that almost imperceptible -and yet how subtly
pleasing-obtusity of outline brought about by the long lapse of
years.</P>

<P>If you are patient and perspicacious-if, at the same time, a
chamber panelled with antique oak should chance to be one of your
unfulfilled ambitions-it were well to search the country diligently
for an old church in process of its restoration-and consequent
improvement out of all knowledge- which will of course involve the
usual dispewment. And this, though it will be bad, decoratively speak
ing, for the sanctuary, will, in the event of your taking an adequate
grip of the situation, prove vastly pleasant for you. The panelling
of those generous old high pews that once screened the weekly
slumbers of the village quality and the diversions of their progeny,
is generally extremely good in design and often admirable in colour
to boot. It may even yet, moreover, be purchased, if not precisely
for an old song, still at a fairly insignificant price. The remoter
the parish the cheaper the panelling; but that goes without saying.
This. at least, is certain, that such chances-and they are not really
rare-seem well worth watching and waiting for, when it is remembered
how immeasurably more beautiful is the antique wainscoting than the
new, and how infinitely less expensive. Besides, is there not the
excitement of the chase?</P>

<P>When a panelled room has been painted the romance of it undergoes
a complete change from grave to gay, from dignity to daintiness; and
yet the daintiness rightly used need by no means be devoid of
dignity. You must cover your chairs and settees with lightly-flowered
chintz, or delicately striped tabouret, and hang old coloured prints
after Morland and Romney, delicate water-colour drawings of, or
after, early English masters, faded miniatures, or the black cameos
of silhouettes-so adorably tender when suggesting a girlish profile-
upon the walls. Your furniture, slender and frail in appearance, but
strong and well-knit in reality, as all good gear must be, whether
stout or slim, should be of a refinement making ever so slightly for
austerity, and yet full of graceful lines, and curves not so subtle
as to exclude all sense of sweetness. If the room be spacious enough
you may even harbour an ear-chair for comfort, an you will'; but
this, although permissible, is not to be greatly desired, unless the
bowed claw-and-ball legs, or their severer substitutes, are of the
first elegance. In all cases the colour of the walls is to be
delicate and yet not sickly, pale, and still with a something of
mellowness. There is a combination of soft salmon pink, "picked out,"
to use the common phrase, with dim willow-green, that is very comely
and reviving; while certain tones of amber and of apricot are not
without their charm.</P>

<P>As for tapestry, most romantic of all hangings the poetry, as it
were, of mural decoration, at its best you- could hardly over praise
it; and here from best to worst there is but a single step, although
that is a long one. The modern Morrisian and the Jacobean are both
equally to be condemned, as failing most essentially in all the
qualities that go to make up a desirable wallcovering. The figures
force themselves upon you, they are always with you, in decided
patterning, importunate anecdote, insistent, and demonstrative. They
press uninvited into the world you live in, for world of their own
they have none; the twilight borderland of the older arras, peopled
by a phantom folk whom you may beckon forth from the shadows and
dismiss again at will, is all unknown of these. Old tapestries are
such stuff as dreams are made of, and they are peopled by the "forms
that sweep the melancholy ways of sleep." They may be enchanted
forests with woven mysteries of grey and green, and the ghostly hunt
sweeping through; or dim chambers in lordly palaces, where forms as
vaguely fair as the conceptions of Matthys Maris, or Monticelli move
to and fro or unearthly meadows trodden by no earthly visitants.
Again-if you are not in the mood-they may be nothing more than
harmonies in low, rich tones, and mistily beautiful colours- the beau
ideal of backgrounds.</P>
