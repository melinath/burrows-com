<P><I>La personnalit&eacute;</I> said one of the greatest of modern
French critics, <I>voil&agrave; ce qui nous sauvera</I>.</P>

<P>But above all things was it a return to Nature --that formula
which seems to suit so many and such diverse movements: they would
draw and paint nothing but what they saw, they would try and imagine
things as they really happened. Later there came to the old house by
Blackfriars Bridge, where this young brotherhood used to meet and
work, two young men from Oxford, Edward Burne-Jones and William
Morris --the latter substituting for the simpler realism of the early
days a more exquisite spirit of choice, a more faultless devotion to
beauty, a more intense seeking for perfection: a master of all
exquisite design and of all spiritual vision. It is of the school of
Florence rather than of that of Venice that he is kinsman, feeling
that the close imitation of Nature is a disturbing clement in
imaginative art. The visible aspect of modern life disturbs him not;
rather is it for him to render eternal all that is beautiful in
Greek;, Italian, and Celtic legend. To Morris we owe poetry whose
perfect precision and clearness of word and vision has not been
excelled in the literature of our country, and by the revival of the
decorative arts he has given to our individualised romantic movement
the social idea and the social factor also.</P>

<P>But the revolution accomplished by this clique of young men, with
Ruskin's faultless and fervent eloquence to help them, was not one of
ideas merely but of execution, not one of conceptions but of
creations.</P>

<P>For the great eras in the history of the development of all the
arts have been eras not of increased feeling or enthusiasm in feeling
for art, but of new technical improvements primarily and specially.
The discovery of marble quarries in the purple ravines of Pentelicus
and on the little low-lying hills of the island of Paros gave to the
Greeks the opportunity for that intensified v vitality of action,
that more sensuous and simple humanism, to which the Egyptian
sculptor working laboriously in the hard porphyry and rose coloured
granite of the desert could not attain. The splendour of the Venetian
school began with the introduction of the new oil medium for
painting. The progress in modern music has been due to the invention
of new instruments entirely, and in no way to an increased
consciousness on the part of the musician of any wider social aim.
The critic may try and trace the deferred resolutions of Beethoven *
to some sense of the incompleteness of the modern intellectual
spirit, but the artist would have answered, as one of them did
afterwards, 'Let them pick out the fifths and leave us at peace.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>* As an instance of the inaccuracy of published reports
   of this lecture, it may be mentioned that all unauthorized
   versions give this passage as <I>The artist may trace the
   depressed revolution of Bunthorne simply to the lack of technical
   mean!</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>And so it is in poetry also: all this love of curious French
metres like the Ballade, the Villanelle, the Rondel; all this
increased value laid on elaborate alliterations, and on curious words
and refrains, such as you will find in Dante Rossetti and Swinburne,
is merely the attempt to perfect flute and viol and trumpet through
which the spirit of the age and the lips of the poet may blow the
music of their many messages.</P>

<P>And so it has been with this romantic movement of ours: it is a
reaction against the empty conventional workmanship, the lax
execution of previous poetry and painting, showing itself in the work
of such men as Rossetti and Burne-Jones by a far greater splendour of
colour, a far more intricate wonder of design than English
imaginative art has shown before In Rossetti's poetry and the poetry
of Morris, Swinburne and Tennyson a perfect precision and choice of
language, a style flawless and fearless, a seeking for all sweet and
precious melodies and a sustaining consciousness of the musical value
of each word are opposed to that value which is merely intellectual.
In this respect they are one with the romantic movement of France of
which not the least characteristic note was struck by
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier's advice to the young poet to read his
dictionary every day, as being the only book worth a poet's
reading.</P>

<P>While, then, the material of workmanship is being thus elaborated
and discovered to have in itself incommunicable and eternal qualities
of its own, qualities entirely satisfying to the poetic sense and not
needing for their aesthetic effect any lofty intellectual vision, any
deep criticism of life or even any passionate human emotion at all,
the spirit and the method of the poet's working--what people call his
inspiration--have not escaped the controlling influence of the
artistic spirit. Not that the imagination has lost its wings, but we
have accustomed ourselves to count their innumerable pulsations, to
estimate their limitless strength, to govern their ungovernable
freedom.</P>

<P>To the Greeks this problem of the conditions of poetic production,
and the places occupied by either spontaneity or self-consciousness
in any artistic work, had a peculiar fascination. We find it in the
mysticism of Plato and in the rationalism of Aristotle. We find it
later in the Italian Renaissance agitating the minds of such men as
Leonardo da Vinci. Schiller tried to adjust the balance between form
and feeling, and Goethe to estimate the position of self
consciousness in art. Wordsworth's definition of poetry as 'emotion
remembered in tranquillity' may be taken as an analysis of one of the
stages through which all imaginative work has to pass; and in Keats's
longing to be 'able to compose without this fever' (I quote from one
of his letters), his desire to substitute for poetic ardour 'a more
thoughtful and quiet power,' we may discern the most important moment
in the evolution of that artistic life. The question made an early
and strange appearance in your literature too; and I need not remind
you how deeply the young poets of the French romantic movement were
excited and stirred by Edgar Allan Poe's analysis of the workings of
his own imagination in the creating of that supreme imaginative work
which we know by the name of <I>The Raven</I>.</P>

<P>In the last century, when the intellectual and didactic element
had intruded to such an extent into the kingdom which belongs to
poetry, it was against the claims of the understanding that an artist
like Goethe had to protest. 'The more incomprehensible to the
understanding a poem is the better for it, he said once, asserting
the complete supremacy of the imagination in poetry as of reason in
prose. But in this century it is rather against the claims of the
emotional faculties, the claims of mere sentiment and feeling, that
the artist must react. The simple utterance of joy is not poetry any
more than a mere personal cry of pain, and the real experiences of
the artist are always those which do not find their direct expression
but are gathered up and absorbed into some artistic form which seems,
from such real experiences, to be the farthest removed and the most
alien.</P>

<P>'The heart contains passion but the imagination alone contains
poetry,' says Charles Baudelaire. This too was the lesson that
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, most subtle of all modern critics, most
fascinating of all modern poets, was never tired of teaching
--'Everybody is affected by a sunrise or a sunset.' The absolute
distinction of the artist is not his capacity to feel nature so much
as his power of rendering it. The entire subordination of all
intellectual and emotional faculties to the vital and informing
poetic principle is the surest sign of the strength of our
Renaissance.</P>

<P>We have seen the artistic spirit working, first in the delightful
and technical sphere of language, the sphere of expression as opposed
to subject then controlling the imagination of the poet in dealing
with his subject. And now I would point out to you its operation in
the choice of subject. The recognition of a separate realm for the
artist, a consciousness of the absolute difference between the world
of art and the world of real fact, between classic grace and absolute
reality, forms not merely the essential element of any aesthetic
charm but is the characteristic of all great imaginative work and of
all great eras of artistic creation - of the age of Phidias as of the
age of Michael Angelo, of the age of Sophocles as of the age of
Goethe.</P>
