<BLOCKQUOTE>A lecture delivered in America during Wilde's tour in
   1882. It was announced as a lecture on 'The Practical Application
   of the Principles of the Aesthetic Theory to Exterior and Interior
   House Decoration, With Observations upon Dress and Personal
   Ornaments.' The earliest date on which it is known to have been
   given is May 11, 1882.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE="+3">I</FONT>N my last lecture I gave you something of the
history of Art in England. I sought to trace the influence of the
French Revolution upon its development. I said something of the song
of Keats and the school of the pre-Raphaelites. But I do not want to
shelter the movement, which I have called the English Renaissance,
under any palladium however noble, or any name however revered. The
roots of it have, indeed, to be sought for in things that have long
passed away, and not, as some suppose, in the fancy of a few young
men -- although I am not altogether sure that there is anything much
better than the fancy of a few young men.</P>

<P>When I appeared before you on a previous occasion, I had seen
nothing of American art save the Doric columns and Corinthian
chimney-pots visible on your Broadway and Fifth Avenue. Since then, I
have been through your country to some fifty or sixty different
cities, I think. I find that what your people need is not so much
high imaginative art but that which hallows the vessels of everyday
use. I suppose that the poet will sing and the artist will paint
regardless whether the world praises or blames. He has his own world
and is independent of his fellow-men. But the handicraftsman is de
pendent on your pleasure and opinion. He needs your encouragement and
he must hare beautiful surroundings. Your people love art but do not
sufficiently honour the handicrafts-man. Of course, those
millionaires who can pillage Europe for their pleasure need have no
care to encourage such; but I speak for those whose desire for
beautiful things is larger than their means. I find that one great
trouble all over is that your workmen are not given to noble designs.
You cannot be indifferent to this, because Art is not something which
you can take or leave. It is a necessity of human life.</P>

<P>And what is the meaning of this beautiful decoration which we call
art? In the first place, it means value to the workman and it means
the pleasure which he most necessarily take in making a beautiful
thing. The mark of all good art is not that the thing done is done
exactly or finely, for machinery may do as much, but that it is
worked out with the head and the workman's heart. I cannot impress
the point too frequently that beautiful and rational designs are
necessary in all work. I did not imagine, until I went into some of
your simpler cities, that there was so much bad work done. I found,
where I went, bad wall-papers horribly designed, and coloured
carpets, and that old offender the horse-hair sofa, whose stolid look
of indifference is always so depressing. I found meaningless
chandeliers and machine-made furniture, generally of rosewood, which
creaked dismally under the weight of the ubiquitous interviewer. I
came across the small iron stone which they always persist in
decorating with machine-made ornaments, and which is as great a bore
as a wet day or any other particularly dreadful institution. When
unusual extravagance was indulged in, it was garnished with two
funeral urns.</P>

<P>It must always be remembered that what is well and carefully made
by an honest workman, after a rational design, increases in beauty
and value as the years go on. The old furniture brought over by the
Pilgrims, two hundred years ago, which I saw in New England, is just
as good and as beautiful to-day as it was when it first came here.
Now, what you must do is to bring artists and handicraftsmen
together. Handicraftsmen cannot live, certainly cannot thrive,
without such companionship. Separate these two and you rob art of all
spiritual motive.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Having done this, you must place your work. man in the midst of
beautiful surroundings. The artist is not dependent on the visible
and the tangible. He has his visions and his dreams to feed on. But
the workman must see lovely forms as he goes to his work in the
morning and returns at eventide. And, in connection with this, I want
to assure you that noble and beautiful designs are never the result
of idle fancy or purposeless day-dreaming. They come only as the
accumulation of habits of long and delightful observation. And yet
such things may not be taught. Right ideas concerning them can
certainly be obtained only by those who have been accustomed to rooms
that are beautiful and colours that are satisfying.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Perhaps one of the most difficult things for us to do is to choose
a notable and joyous dress for men. There would be more joy in life
if we were to accustom ourselves to use all the beautiful colours we
can in fashioning our own clothes. The dress of the future, I think,
will use drapery to a great extent and will abound with joyous
colour. At present we have lost all nobility of dress and, in doing
so, have almost annihilated the modern sculptor. And, in looking
around at the figures which adorn our parks, one could almost wish
that we had completely killed the noble art. To see the frock-coat of
the drawing-room done in bronze, or the double waistcoat perpetuated
in marble, adds a new horror to death. But indeed, in looking through
the history of costume, seeking an answer to the questions we have
propounded, there is little that is either beautiful or appropriate.
One of the earliest forms is the Greek drapery which is exquisite for
young girls. And then, I think we may be pardoned a little enthusiasm
over the dress of the time of Charles I., so beautiful indeed, that
in spite of its invention being with the Cavaliers it was copied by
the Puritans. And the dress for the children of that time must not be
passed over. It was a very golden age of the little ones. I do not
think that they have ever looked so lovely as they do in the pictures
of that time. The dress of the last century in England is also
peculiarly gracious and graceful. There is nothing bizarre or strange
about it, but it is full of harmony and beauty. In these days,, when
we have suffered dreadfully from the incursions of the modern
milliner, we hear ladies boast that they do not wear a dress more
than once. In the old days, when the dresses were decorated with
beautiful designs and worked with exquisite embroidery, ladies rather
took a pride in bringing out the garment and wearing it many times
and handing it down to their daughters--a process that would, I
think, be quite appreciated by a modern husband when called upon to
settle his wife's bills.</P>

<P>And how shall men dress? Men say that they do not particularly
care how they dress, and that it is little matter. I am bound to
reply that I do not think that you do. In all my journeys through the
country, the only well-dressed men that I saw - and in saying this I
earnestly deprecate the polished indignation of your Fifth Avenue
dandies--were the Western miners. Their wide-brimmed hats, which
shaded their faces from the sun and protected them from the rain, and
the cloak, which is by far the most beautiful piece of drapery ever
invented, may well be dwelt on with admiration. Their high boots,
too, were sensible and practical. They wore only what was
comfortable, and therefore beautiful. As I looked at them I could not
help thinking with regret of the time when these picturesque miners
would have made their fortunes and would go East to assume again all
tile abominations of modern fashionable attire. Indeed, so concerned
was I that 1 made some of them promise that when they again appeared
in the more crowded scenes of Eastern civilisation they would still
continue to wear their lovely costume. But I do not believe they
will.</P>

<P>Now, what America wants to-day is a school of rational art. Bad
art is a great deal worse than no art at all. You must show your
workmen specimens of good work so that they come to know what is
simple and true and beautiful. To that end I would have you have a
museum attached to these schools--not one of those dreadful modern
institutions where there is a stuffed and very dusty giraffe, and a
case or two of fossils, but a place where there are gathered examples
of art decoration from various periods and countries. Such a place is
the South Kensington Museum in London, whereon we build greater hopes
for the future than on any other one thing. There I go every Saturday
night, when the museum is open later than usual, to see the
handicraftsman, the wood-worker, the glass-blower and the worker in
metals. And it is here that the man of refinement and culture comes
face to face with the workman who ministers to his joy. He comes to
know more of the nobility of the workman, and the workman, feeling
the appreciation, comes to know more of the nobility of his work.</P>

<P>You have too many white walls. More colour is wanted. You should
have such men as Whistler among you to teach you the beauty and joy
of colour. Take Mr. Whistler's 'Symphony in White,' which you no
doubt have imagined to be something quite bizarre. It is nothing of
the sort. Think of a cool grey sky flecked here and there with white
clouds, a grey ocean and three wonderfully beautiful figures robed in
white, leaning over the water and dropping white flowers from their
fingers. Here is no extensive intellectual scheme to trouble you, and
no metaphysics of which we have had quite enough in art. But if the
simple and unaided colour strike the right keynote, the whole
conception is made clear. I regard Mr. Whistler's famous Peacock Room
as the finest thing in colour and art decoration which the world has
known since Correggio painted that wonderful room in Italy where the
little children are dancing on the walls. Mr. Whistler finished
another room just before I came away--a breakfast room in blue and
yellow. The ceiling was a light blue, the cabinet-work and the
furniture were of a yellow wood, the curtains at the windows were
white and worked in yellow, and when the table was set for breakfast
with dainty blue china nothing can be conceived at once so simple and
so joyous.</P>
