<P>And this love of definite conception, this clearness of vision,
this artistic sense of limit, is the characteristic of all great work
and poetry;</P>

<P>of the vision of Homer as of the vision of Dante, of Keats and
William Morris as of Chaucer and Theocritus. It lies at the base of
all noble, realistic and romantic work as opposed to the colourless
and empty abstractions of our own eighteenth-century poets anti of
the classical dramatists of France, or of the vague spiritualities of
the German sentimental school: opposed, too, to that spirit of
transcendentalism which also was root and flower itself of the great
Revolution, underlying the impassioned contemplation of Wordsworth
and giving wings and fire to the eagle-like flight of Shelley, and
which in the sphere of philosophy, though displaced by the
materialism and positiveness of our day, bequeathed two great schools
of thought, the school of Newman to Oxford, the school of Emerson to
America. Yet is this spirit of transcendentalism alien to the spirit
of art. For the artist can accept no sphere of life in exchange for
life itself. For him there is no escape from the bondage of the
earth: there is not even the desire of escape.</P>

<P>He is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is the
essence of the transcendental spirit, is alien to him. The
metaphysical mind of Asia will create for itself the monstrous, many
breasted idol of Ephesus, but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is
most instinct with spiritual life which conforms most clearly to the
perfect facts of physical life.</P>

<P>'The storm of revolution,' as Andre Chenier said, 'blows out the
torch of poetry.' It is not for some little time that the real
influence of such a wild cataclysm of things is felt: at first the
desire for equality seems to have produced personalities of more
giant and Titan stature than the world had ever known before. Men
heard the lyre of Byron and the legions of Napoleon; it was a period
of measureless passions and of measureless despair; ambition,
discontent, were the chords of life and art; the age was an age of
revolt: a phase through which the human spirit must pass, but one in
which it cannot rest. For the aim of culture is not rebellion but
peace, the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash by night being
no dwelling-place meet for her to whom the gods have assigned the
fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear, untroubled air.</P>

<P>And soon that desire for perfection, which la, at the base of the
Revolution, found in a young English poet its most complete and
flawless realisation.</P>

<P>Phidias and the achievements of Greek art are foreshadowed in
Homer: Dante prefigures for us the passion and colour and intensity
of Italian painting: the modern love of landscape dates from
Rousseau, and it is in Keats that one discerns the beginning of the
artistic renaissance of England.</P>

<P>Byron was a rebel and Shelley a dreamer; but in the calmness and
clearness of his vision, his perfect self-control, his unerring sense
of beauty and his recognition of a separate realm for the
imagination, Keats was the pure and serene artist the forerunner of
the pre-Raphaelite school, and so of the great romantic movement of
which I am to speak.</P>

<P>Blake had indeed, before him, claimed for art a lofty, spiritual
mission, and had striven to raise design to the ideal level of poetry
and music, but the remoteness of his vision both in painting and
poetry and the incompleteness of his technical powers had been
adverse to any real influence. It is in Keats that the artistic
spirit of this century first found its absolute incarnation.</P>

<P>And these pre-Raphaelites, what were they? If you ask nine-tenths
of the British public what is the meaning of the word aesthetics,
they will tell you it is the French for affectation or the German for
a dado; and if you inquire about the pre-Raphaelites you will hear
something about an eccentric lot of young men to whom a sort of
divine crookedness and holy awkwardness in drawing were the chief
objects of art. To know nothing about their great men is one of the
necessary elements of English education.</P>

<P>As regards the pre-Raphaelites the story is simple enough. In the
year 1847 a number of young men in London, poets and painters,
passionate admirers of Keats all of them, formed the habit of meeting
together for discussions on art, the result of such discussions being
that the English Philistine public was roused suddenly from its
ordinary apathy by hearing that there was in its midst a body of
young men who had determined to revolutionise English painting and
poetry. They called themselves the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.</P>

<P>In England, then as now, it was enough for a man to try and
produce any serious beautiful work; to lose all his rights as a
citizen; and besides this, the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood-- among
whom the names of Dante Rossetti, Holman Hunt and Millais will be
familiar to you--had on their side three things that the English
public never forgives: youth, power and enthusiasm.</P>

<P>Satire, always as sterile as it is shameful and as impotent as it
is insolent, paid them that usual homage which mediocrity pays to
genius --doing, here as always, infinite harm to the public, blinding
them to what is beautiful, teaching them that irreverence which is
the source of all vileness and narrowness of life, but harming the
artist not at all, rather confirming him in the perfect rightness of
his work; and ambition. For to disagree with three fourths of the
British public on all points is one of the first elements of sanity,
one of the deepest consolations in all moments of spiritual
doubt.</P>

<P>As regards the ideas these young men brought to the regeneration
of English art, we may see at the base of their artistic creations a
desire for a deeper spiritual value to be given to art as well as a
more decorative value.</P>

<P>Pre-Raphaelites they called themselves; not that they imitated the
early Italian masters at all, but that in their work, as opposed to
the facile abstractions of Raphael, they found a stronger realism of
imagination, a more careful realism of technique, a vision at once
more fervent and more vivid, an individuality more intimate and more
intense.</P>

<P>For it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the
aesthetic demands of its age: there must be also about it, if it is
to affect us with any permanent delight, the impress of a distinct
individuality, an individuality remote from that of ordinary men, and
coming near to us only by virtue of a certain newness and wonder in
the work, and through channels whose very strangeness makes us more
ready to give them welcome.</P>
