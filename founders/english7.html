That is what Plato thought decorative art could do for a nation,
feeling that the secret not of philosophy merely but of all gracious
existence might be externally hidden from any one whose youth had
been passed in uncomely and vulgar surroundings, and that the beauty
of form and colour even, as he says, in the meanest vessels of the
house, will find its way into the inmost places of the soul and lead
the boy naturally to look for that divine harmony of spiritual life
of which art was to him the material symbol and warrant.</P>

<P>Prelude indeed to all knowledge and all wisdom will this love of
beautiful things be for us; yet there are times when wisdom becomes a
burden and knowledge is one with sorrow: for as every body has its
shadow so every soul has its septicism. In such dread moments of
discord and despair where should we, of this torn and troubled age,
turn our steps if not to that secure house of beauty where there is
always a little forgetfulness, always a great joy; to that <I>citta
divina</I> as the old Italian heresy called it, the divine city where
one can stand, though only for a brief moment, apart from the
division and terror of the world and the choice of the world too?</P>

<P>This is that <I>consolation des arts</I> which is the key-note of
Gautier's poetry, the secret of modern life foreshadowed--as indeed
what in our century is not? -- by Goethe. You remember what he said
to the German people: 'Only have the courage,' he said, 'to give
yourselves up to your impressions, allow yourselves to be delighted,
moved, elevated, nay instructed, inspired for something great. The
courage to give yourselves up to your impressions: yes, that is the
secret of the artistic life--for while art has been defined as an
escape from the tyranny of the senses, it is an escape rather from
the tyranny of the soul. But only to those who worship her above all
things does she ever reveal her true treasure: else will she be as
powerless to aid you as the mutilated Venus of the Louvre was before
the romantic but sceptical nature of Heine.</P>

<P>And indeed I think it would be impossible to overrate the gain
that might follow if we had about us only what gave pleasure to the
maker of it and gives pleasure to its user, that being the simplest
of all rules about decoration. One thing, at least, I think it would
do for us: there is no surer test of a great country than how near it
stands to its own poets; but between the singers of our day and the
workers to whom they would sing there seems to be an ever widening
and dividing chasm, a chasm which slander and mockery cannot
traverse, but which is spanned by the luminous wings of love.</P>

<P>And of such love I think that the abiding presence in our houses
of noble imaginative work would be the surest seed and preparation. I
do not mean merely as regards that direct literary expression of art
by which, from the little red and black cruse of oil or wine, a Greek
boy could learn of the lionlike splendour of Achilles, of the
strength of Hector and the beauty of Paris and the wonder of Helen,
long before he stood and listened in crowded market place or in
theatre of marble; or by which an Italian child of the fifteenth
century could know of the chastity of Lucrece and the death of
Camilla from carven doorway and from painted chest For the good we
get from art is not what we learn from it; it is what we become
through it. Its real influence will be in giving the mind that
enthusiasm which is the secret of Hellenism, accustoming it to demand
from art all that art can do in rearranging the facts of common life
for us--whether it be by giving the most spiritual interpretation of
one's own moments of highest passion or the most sensuous expression
of those thoughts that are the farthest removed from sense; in
accustoming it to love the things of the imagination for their own
sake, and to desire beauty and grace in all things. For he who does
not love art in all things does not love it at all, and he who does
not need art in all things does not need it at all.</P>

<P>I will not dwell here on what I am sure has delighted you all in
our great Gothic cathedrals. I mean how the artist of that time,
handicrafts" man himself in stone or glass, found the best motives
for his art, always ready for his hand and always beautiful, in the
daily work of the artificers he saw around him--as in those lovely
windows of Chartres--where the dyer dips in the vat and the potter
sits at the wheel, and the weaver stands at the loom real
manufacturers these, workers with the hand, and entirely delightful
to look at, not like the smug and vapid shopman of our time, who
knows nothing of the web or vase he sells, except that he is charging
you double its value and thinking you a fool for buying it. Nor can I
but just note, in passing, the immense influence the decorative work
of Greece and Italy had on its artists, the one teaching the sculptor
that restraining influence of design which is the glory of the
Parthenon, the other keeping painting always true to its primary,
pictorial condition of noble colour which is the secret of the school
of Venice; for I wish rather, in this lecture at least, to dwell on
the effect that decorative art has on human life--on its social not
its purely artistic effect.</P>

<P>There are two kinds of men in the world, two great creeds, two
different forms of natures: men to whom the end of life is action,
and men to whom the end of life is thought.. As regards the latter,
who seek for experience itself and not for the fruits of experience,
who must burn always with one of the passions of this fiery-coloured
world, who find life interesting not for its secret but for its
situations, for its pulsations and not for its purpose; the passion
for beauty engendered by the decorative arts will be to them more
satisfying than any political or religious enthusiasm, any enthusiasm
for humanity, any ecstasy or sorrow for love. For art comes to one
professing primarily to give nothing but the highest quality to one's
moments, and for those moments. sake. So far for those to whom the
end of life is thought. As regards the others, who hold that life is
inseparable from labour, to them should this movement be specially
dear: for, if our days are barren without industry, industry without
art is barbarism.</P>

<P>Hewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeed
amoung us. Our modern machinery has not much tightened the labour of
man after all: but at least let the pitcher that stands by the well
be beautiful and surely the labour of the day will be lightened: let
the wood be made receptive of some lovely form, some gracious design,
and there will come no longer discontent but joy to the toiler. For
what is decoration but the worker's expression of joy in his work?
And not joy merely--that is a great thing yet not enough--but that
opportunity of expressing his own individuality which, as it is the
essence of all life, is the source of all art. 'I have tried,' I
remember William Morris saying to me once, 'I have tried to make each
of my workers an artist, and when I say an artist 1 mean a man.' For
the worker then, handicraftsman of whatever kind he is, art is no
longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over the
whitened body of a leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his
luxury, but rather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that
has in it something beautiful and noble.</P>

<P>And so you must seek out your workman and give him, as far as
possible, the right surroundings, for remember that the real test and
virtue of a workman is not his earnestness nor his industry even, but
his power of design merely; and that 'design is not the offspring of
idle fancy: it is the studied result of accumulative observation and
delightful habit.' All the teaching in the world is of no avail if
you do not surround your workman with happy influences and with
beautiful things. It is impossible for him to have right ideas about
colour unless he sees the lovely colours of Nature unspoiled;
impossible for him to supply beautiful incident and action unless he
sees beautiful incident and action in the world about him.</P>

<P>For to cultivate sympathy you must be among living things and
thinking about them, and to cultivate admiration you must be among
beautiful things and looking at them. 'The steel of Toledo and the
silk of Genoa did but give strength to oppression and lustre to
pride,' as Mr. Ruskin says; let it be for you to create an art that
is made by the hands of the people for the joy of the people, to
please the hearts of the people, too; an art that will be your
expression of your delight in life. There is nothing 'in common life
too mean, in common things too trivial to be ennobled by your touch;
nothing in life that art cannot sanctify.</P>

<P>You have heard, I think, a few of you, of two flowers connected
with the aesthetic movement in England, and said (I assure you,
erroneously) to be the food of some esthetic young men. Well, let me
tell you that the reason we love the lily and the sunflower, in spite
of what Mr. Gilbert may tell you, is not for any vegetable fashion at
all. It is because these two lovely flowers are in England the two
most perfect models of design, the most naturally adapted for
decorative art--the gaudy leonine beauty of the one and the precious
loveliness of the other giving to the artist the most entire and
perfect joy. And so with you: let there be no flower in your meadows
that does not wreathe its tendrils around your pillows, no little
leaf in your Titan forests that does not lend its form to design, no
curving spray of wild rose or brier that does not live for ever in
carven arch or window or marble, no bird in your air that is not
giving the iridescent wonder of its colour, the exquisite curves of
its wings in flight, to make more precious the preciousness of simple
adornment. For the voices that have their dwelling in sea and
mountain are not the chosen music of liberty only. Other messages are
there in the wonder of wind-swept heights and the majesty of silent
deep--messages that, if you will listen to them, will give you the
wonder of all new imagination, the treasure of all new beauty.</P>

<P>We spend our days, each one of us, in looking for the secret of
life. Well, the secret of life is in art.</P>
