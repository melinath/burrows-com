<H2><CENTER>Embroidery on William Morris's<BR>
Bed at Kelmscott Manor.</CENTER></H2>

<P>In William Morris's room at Kelmscott Manor, the early-seventeenth
century carved oak bed has an embroidered valance and bed-hangings
that were designed in 1891 by May Morris, his daughter, and worked by
May with the help of Lily Yeats and Ellen Wright (two Morris &amp;
Co. embroiderers). The poem "For the Bed at Kelmscott" was written by
William Morris for the project. May Morris also designed the
bedcover, which was embroidered by Jane Morris, William Morris's
wife. Further information can be found in a chapter on 'May Morris,
embroidery and Kelmscott' by Linda Parry, from the book: William
Morris, Art and Kelmscott, edited by Linda Parry, Suffolk, England:
The Boydell Press and The Society of Antiquaries of London, 1996.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>'For the Bed at Kelmscott', by William Morris
   
   <P>The wind's on the wold<BR>
   And the night is a-cold,<BR>
   And Thames runs chill<BR>
   Twixt mead and hill,<BR>
   But kind and dear<BR>
   Is the old house here,<BR>
   And my heart is warm<BR>
   Midst winter's harm.<BR>
   Rest then and rest,<BR>
   And think of the best<BR>
   Twixt summer and spring<BR>
   When all birds sing<BR>
   In the town of the tree,<BR>
   As ye lie in me<BR>
   And scarce dare move<BR>
   Lest earth and its love<BR>
   Should fade away<BR>
   Ere the full of the day.</P>
   
   <P>I am old and have seen<BR>
   Many things that have been,<BR>
   Both grief and peace,<BR>
   And wane and increase.<BR>
   No tale I tell<BR>
   Of ill or well,<BR>
   But this I say,<BR>
   Night treadeth on day,<BR>
   And for worst and best<BR>
   Right good is rest.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
