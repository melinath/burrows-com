<CENTER>Continued - Part 2</CENTER>

<P>

<HR>

Ours has been the first movement which has brought the handicraftsman
and the artist together, for remember that by separating the one from
the other you do ruin to both; you rob the one of all spiritual
motive and all imaginative joy, you isolate the other from all real
technical perfection. The two greatest schools of art in the world,
the sculptor at Athens and the school of painting at Venice, had
their origin entirely in a long succession of simple and earnest
handicraftsmen. It was the Greek potter who taught the sculptor that
restraining influence of design which was the glory of the Parthenon;
it was the Italian decorator of chests and household goods who kept
Venetian painting always true to its primary pictorial condition of
noble colour For we should remember that all the arts are fine arts
and all the arts decorative arts. The greatest triumph of Italian
painting was the decoration of a pope's chapel in Rome and the wall
of a room in Venice. Michael Angelo wrought the one, and Tintoret,
the dyer's son, the other. And the little ' Dutch landscape, which
you put over your sideboard to-day, and between the windows
to-morrow, is' no less a glorious 'piece of work than the extents of
field and forest with which Benozzo has made green and beautiful the
once melancholy arcade of the Campo Santo at Pisa,' as Ruskin
says.</P>

<P>Do not imitate the works of a nation, Greek or Japanese, Italian
or English; but their artistic spirit of design and their artistic
attitude to-day, their own world, you should absorb but imitate
never, copy never. Unless you can make as beautiful a design in
painted china or embroidered screen or beaten brass out of your
American turkey as the Japanese does out of his grey silver-winged
stork, you will never do anything. Let the Greek carve his lions and
the Goth his dragons: buffalo and wild deer are the animals for
you.</P>

<P>Golden rod and aster and rose and all the flowers that cover your
valleys in the spring and your hills in the autumn: let them be the
flowers for your art. Not merely has Nature given you the noblest
motives for a new school of decoration, but to you above all other
countries has she given the utensils to work in.</P>

<P>You have quarries of marble richer than Pentelicus, more varied
than Paros, but do not build a great white square house of marble and
think that it is beautiful, or that you are using marble nobly. If
you build in marble you must either carve it into joyous decoration,
like the lives of dancing children that adorn the marble castles of
the Loire, or fill it with beautiful sculpture, frieze and pediment,
as the Greeks did, or inlay it with other coloured marbles as they
did in Venice. Otherwise you had better build in simple red brick as
your Puritan fathers, with no presence and with some beauty. Do not
treat your marble as if it was ordinary stone and build a house of
mere blocks of it. For it is indeed a precious stone, this marble of
yours, and only workmen of nobility of invention and delicacy of hand
should be allowed to touch it at all, carving it into noble statues
or into beautiful decoration, or inlaying it with other coloured
marbles: for the true colours of architecture are those of natural
stone, and I would fain see them taken advantage of to the full.
Every variety is here, from pale yellow to purple passing through
orange, red, and brown, entirely at your command; nearly every kind
of green and grey also is attainable, and with these and with pure
white what harmony might you not achieve. Of stained and variegated
stone the quantity is unlimited, the kinds innumerable. Were brighter
colours required, let glass, and gold protected by glass, be used in
mosaic, a kind of work as durable as the solid stone and incapable of
losing its lustre by time. And let the painter's work be reserved for
the shadowed loggia and inner chamber.</P>

<P>This is the true and faithful way of building. Where this cannot
be, the device of external colouring may indeed be employed without
dishonour-- but it must be with the warning reflection that a time
will come when such aids will pass awe' and when the building will be
judged in its lifelessness, dying the death of the dolphin. Better
the less bright, more enduring fabric. The transparent alabasters of
San Miniato and the mosaics of Saint Mark's are more warmly filled
and more brightly touched by every return of morning and evening,
while the hues of the Gothic cathedrals have died like the ills out
of the cloud, and the temples, whose azure and purple once flamed
above the Grecian promontory, stand in their faded whiteness like
snows which the sunset has left cold.</P>

<P>I do not know anything so perfectly commonplace in design as most
modern jewellery. How easy for you to change that and to produce
gold-smiths work that would be a joy to all of us. The gold is ready
for you in unexhausted treasure, stored up in the mountain hollow or
strewn on the river sand, and was not given to you merely for barren
speculation. There should be some better record of it left in your
history than the merchant's panic and the ruined home. We do not
remember often enough how constantly the history of a great nation
will live in and by its art. Only a few thin wreaths of beaten gold
remain to tell us of the stately empire of Etruria; and, while from
the streets of Florence the noble knight and haughty duke have long
since passed away, the gates which the simple goldsmith Ghiberti made
for their pleasure still guard their lovely house of baptism, worthy
still of the praise of Michael Angelo who called them worthy to be
the Gates of Paradise.</P>

<P>Have then your school of design, search out your workmen and, when
you find one who has delicacy of hand and that wonder of invention
necessary for goldsmiths' work, do not leave him to toil in obscurity
and dishonour and have a great glaring shop and two great glaring
shop boys in it (not to take your orders: they never do that; but to
force you to buy something you do not want at all). When you want a
thing wrought in gold, goblet or shield for the feast, necklace or
wreath for the women, tell him what you like most in decoration,
flower or wreath, bird in flight or hound in the chase, image of the
woman you love or the friend you honour. Watch him as he beats out
the gold into those thin plates delicate as the petals of a yellow
rose, or draws it into the long wires like tangled sunbeams at dawn.
Whoever that workman be, help him, cherish him, and you will have
such lovely work from his hand as will be a joy to you for all
time.</P>

<P>This is the spirit of our movement in England, and this is the
spirit in which we would wish you to work, making eternal by your art
all that is noble in your men and women, stately in your lakes and
mountains, beautiful in your own flowers and natural life. We want to
see that you have nothing in your houses that has not been a joy to
the man who made it, and is not a joy to those that use it. We want
to see you create an art made by the hands of the people to please
the hearts of the people too. Do you like this spirit or not? Do you
think it simple and strong, noble in its aim, and beautiful in its
result? I know you do.</P>

<P>Folly and slander have their own way for a little time, but for a
little time only. You now know what we mean: you will be able to
estimate what is said of us--its value and its motive.</P>

<P>There should be a law that no ordinary newspaper should be allowed
to write about art. The harm they do by their foolish and random
writing it would be impossible to overestimate --not to the artist
but to the public, blinding them to all, but harming the artist not
at all. Without them we would judge a man simply by his work; but at
present the newspapers are trying hard to induce the public to judge
a sculptor, for instance, never by his statues but by the way he
treats his wife; a painter by the amount of his income and a poet by
the colour of his neck-tie. I said there should be a law, but there
is really no necessity for a new law: nothing could be easier than to
bring the ordinary critic under the head of the criminal classes. But
let us leave such an inartistic subject and return to beautiful and
comely things, remembering that the art which would represent the
spirit of modern newpapers would be exactly the art which you and I
want to avoid--grotesque art, malice mocking you from every gateway,
slander sneering at you from every corner.</P>

<P>Perhaps you may be surprised at my talking of labour and the
workman. You have heard of me, I fear, through the medium of your
some what imaginative newspapers as, if not a 'Japanese young man,'
at least a young man to whom the rush and clamour and reality of the
modern world were distasteful, and whose greatest difficulty in life
was the difficulty of living up to the level of his blue china --a
paradox from which England has not yet recovered.</P>

<P>Well, let me tell you how it first came to me at all to create an
artistic movement in England, a movement to show the rich what
beautiful things they might enjoy and the poor what beautiful things
they might create.</P>

<P>One summer afternoon in Oxford -- 'that sweet city with her
dreaming spires,' lovely as Venice in its splendour, noble in its
learning as Rome, down the long High Street that winds from tower to
tower, past silent cloister and stately gateway, till it reaches that
long, grey seven-arched bridge which Saint Mary used to guard (used
to, I say, because they are now pulling it down to build a tramway
and a light cast-iron bridge in its place, desecrating the loveliest
city in England)--well, we were coming down the street--a troop of
young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, going to river or
tennis-court or cricket-field-- when Ruskin going up to lecture in
cap and gown met us. He seemed troubled and prayed us to go back with
him to his lecture, which a few of us did, and there he spoke to us
not on art this time but on life, saying that it seemed to him to be
wrong that all the best physique and strength of the young men in
England should be spent aimlessly on cricket ground or river. without
any result at all except that if one rowed well one got a pewter-pot,
sod if one made a good score, a cane-handled bat. He thought, he
said, that we should be working at something that would do good to
other people, at something by which we might show that in all labour
there was something noble. Well, we were a good deal moved, and said
we would do anything he wished. So he went out round Oxford and found
two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a
great swamp, so that the villagers could not pass from one to the
other without many miles of a round. And when we came back in winter
he asked us to help him to make a road across this morass for these
village people to use. So out we went, day after day, and learned how
to lay levels and to break stones, and to wheel barrows along a
plank-- a very difficult thing to do. And Ruskin worked with us in
the mist and rain and mud of an Oxford winter, and our friends and
our enemies came out and mocked us from the bank. We did not mind-it
much then, and we did not mind it afterwards at all, but worked away
for two months at our road And what became of the road? Well, like a
bad lecture it ended abruptly--in the middle of the swamp. Ruskin
going away to Venice, when we came back for the next term there was
no leader, and the 'diggers,' as they called us, fell asunder. And I
felt that if there was enough spirit amongst the young men to go out
to such work as road-making for the sake of a noble ideal of life, I
could from them create an artistic movement that might change, as it
has changed, the face of England. So I sought them out--leader they
would call me--but there was no leader: we were all searchers only
and we were bound to each other by noble friendship and by noble art.
There was none of us idle: poets most of us, so ambitious were we:
painters some of us, or workers in metal or modellers, determined
that we would try and create for ourselves beautiful work: for the
handicraftsman beautiful work, for those who love us poems and
pictures, for those who love us not epigrams and paradoxes and
scorn.</P>

<P>Well, we have done something in England and we will do something
more. Now, I do not want you, believe me, to ask your brilliant young
men, your beautiful young girls, to go out and make a road on a swamp
for any village in America, but I think you might each of you have
some art to practice.</P>

<P>We must have, as Emerson said, a mechanical craft for our culture,
a basis for our higher accomplishments in the work of our hands--the
uselessness of most people's hands seems to me one of the most
unpractical things. 'No separation from labour can be without some
loss of power or truth to the seer,' says Emerson again. The heroism
which would make on us the impression of Epaminondas must be that of
a domestic conqueror. The hero of the future is he who shall bravely
and gracefully subdue this Gorgon of fashion and of convention.</P>

<P>When you have chosen your own part, abide by it, and do not weakly
try and reconcile yourself with the world. The heroic cannot be the
common nor the common the heroic. Congratulate yourself if you have
done something strange and extravagant and broken the monotony of a
decorous age.</P>

<P>And lastly, let us remember that art is the one thing which Death
cannot harm. The little house at Concord may be desolate, but the
wisdom of New England's Plato is not silenced nor the brilliancy of
that Attic genius dimmed: the lips of Longfellow are still musical
for us though his dust be turning into the flowers which he loved:
and as it is with the greater artists, poet and philosopher and
song-bird, so let it be with you.</P>
