<HR>

Art never harms itself by keeping aloof from the social problems of
the day: rather, by so doing, it more completely realises for us that
which we desire. For to most of us the real life is the life we do
not lead, and thus, remaining more true to the essence of its own
perfection, more jealous of its own unattainable beauty, is less
likely to forget form in feeling or to accept the passion of creation
as any substitute for the beauty of the created thing.</P>

<P>The artist is indeed the child of his own age, but the present
will not be to him a whit more real than the past; for, like the
philosopher of the Platonic vision, the poet is the spectator of all
time and of all existence. For him no form is obsolete, 210 subject
out of date; rather, whatever of life and passion the world has
known, in desert of Judaea or in Arcadian valley, by the rivers of
Troy or the rivers of Damascus, in the crowded and hideous streets of
a modern city or by the pleasant ways of Camelot--all lies before him
like an open scroll, all is still instinct with beautiful life. He
will take of it what is salutary for his own spirit, no more;
choosing some facts and rejecting others with the calm artistic
control of one who is in possession of the secret of beauty.</P>

<P>There is indeed a poetical attitude to be adopted towards all
things, but all things are not fit subjects for poetry. Into the
secure and sacred house of Beauty the true artist will admit nothing
that is harsh or disturbing, nothing that gives pain, nothing that is
debatable, nothing about which men argue. He can steep himself, if he
wishes, in the discussion of all the social problems of his day,
poor-laws and local taxation, free trade and bimetallic currency, and
the like; but when he writes on these subjects it will be, as Milton
nobly expressed it, with his left hand, in prose and not in verse, in
a pamphlet and not in a lyric. This exquisite spirit of artistic
choice was not in Byron Wordsworth had it not. In the work of both
these men there is much that we have to reject, much that does not
give us that sense of calm and perfect repose which should be the
effect of all fine, imaginative work But in Keats it seemed to have
been incarnate, and in his lovely <I>Ode on a Grecian Urn</I> it
found its most secure and faultless expression; in the pageant of the
<I>Earthly Paradise</I> and the knights and ladies of Burne-Jones it
is the one dominant note.</P>

<P>It is to no avail that the Muse of Poetry be called, even by such
a clarion note as Whitman's, to migrate from Greece and Ionia and to
placard REMOVED and TO LET on the rocks of the snowy Parnassus.
Calliope's call is not yet closed, nor are the epics of Asia ended;
the Sphinx is not yet silent, nor the fountain of Castaly dry. For
art is very life itself and knows nothing of death; she is absolute
truth and takes no care of fact; she sees (as I remember Mr.
Swinburne insisting on at dinner) that Achilles is even now more
actual and real than Wellington, not merely more noble and
interesting as a type and figure but more positive and real.</P>

<P>Literature must rest always on a principle, and temporal
considerations are no principle at all. For to the poet all times and
places are one; the stuff he deals with is eternal and eternally the
same: no theme is inept, no past or present preferable. The steam
whistle will not affright him nor the flutes of Arcadia weary him:
for him there is but one time, the artistic moment; but one law, the
law of form; but one land, the land of Beauty--a land removed indeed
from the real world and yet more sensuous because more enduring;
calm, yet with that calm which dwells in the faces of the Greek
statues, the calm which comes not from the rejection but from the
absorption of passion, the calm which despair and sorrow cannot
disturb but intensify only. And so it comes that he who seems to
stand most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best, because he
has stripped life of what is accidental and transitory, stripped it
of that 'mist of familiarity which makes life obscure to us.'</P>

<P>Those strange, wild-eyed sibyls fixed eternally in the whirlwind
of ecstasy, those mighty-limbed and Titan prophets, labouring with
the secret of the earth and the burden of mystery, that guard and
glorify the chapel of Pope Sixtus at Rome --do they not tell us more
of the real spirit of the Italian Renaissance, of the dream of
Savonarola and of the sin of Borgia, than all the brawling boors and
cooking women of Dutch art can teach us of the real spirit of the
history of Holland?</P>

<P>And so in our own day, also, the two most vital tendencies of the
nineteenth century--the democratic and pantheistic tendency and the
tendency to value life for the sake of art--found their most complete
and perfect utterance in the poetry of Shelley and Keats who, to the
blind eyes of their own time, seemed to be as wanderers in the
wilderness, preachers of vague or unreal things. And I remember once,
in talking to Mr. Burne-Jones about modern science, his saying to me,
'the more materialistic science becomes, the more angels shall I
paint: their wings are my protest in favour of the immortality of the
soul.'</P>

<P>But these are the intellectual speculations that underlie art.
Where in the arts themselves are we to find that breadth of human
sympathy which is the condition of all noble work; where in the arts
are we to look for what Mazzini would call the social ideas as
opposed to the merely personal ideas? By virtue of what claim do I
demand for the artist the love and loyalty of the men and women of
the world? I think I can answer that.</P>

<P>Whatever spiritual message an artist brings to his aid is a matter
for his own soul. He may bring judgment like Michael Angelo or peace
like Angelico; he may come with mourning like the great Athenian or
with mirth like the singer of Sicily; nor is it for us to do aught
but accept his teaching, knowing that we cannot smite the bitter lips
of Leopardi into laughter or burden with our discontent Goethe's
serene calm. But for warrant of its truth such message must have the
flame of eloquence in the lips that speak it, splendour and glory in
the vision that is its witness, being justified by one thing only -
the flawless beauty and perfect form of its expression: this indeed
being the social idea, being the meaning of joy in art.</P>

<P>Not laughter where none should laugh, nor tile calling of peace
where there is no peace; not in painting the subject ever, but the
pictorial charm only, the wonder of its colour, the satisfying beauty
of its design.</P>

<P>You have most of you seen, probably, that great masterpiece of
Rubens which hangs in the gallery of Brussels, that swift and
wonderful pageant of horse and rider arrested in its most exquisite
and fiery moment when the winds are caught in crimson banner and the
air lit by the gleam of armour and the flash of plume. Well, that is
joy in art, though that golden hillside be trodden by the wounded
feet of Christ and it is for the death of the Son of Man that that
gorgeous cavalcade is passing.</P>

<P>But this restless modern intellectual spirit of ours is not
receptive enough of the sensuous element of art; and so the real
influence of the arts is hidden from many of us: only a few, escaping
from the tyranny of the soul, have learned the secret of those high
hours when thought is not.</P>

<P>And this indeed is the reason of the influence which Eastern art
is having on us in Europe, and of the fascination of all Japanese
work While the Western world has been laying on art the intolerable
burden of its own intellectual doubts and the spiritual tragedy of
its own sorrows, the East has always kept true to art's primary and
pictorial conditions.</P>

<P>In judging of a beautiful statue the esthetic faculty is
absolutely and completely gratified by the splendid curves of those
marble lips that are dumb to our complaint, the noble modelling of
those limbs that are powerless to help us. In its primary aspect a
painting has no more spiritual message or meaning than an exquisite
fragment of Venetian glass or a blue tile from the wall of Damascus:
it is a beautifully coloured surface, nothing more. The channels by
which all noble imaginative work in painting should touch, and do
touch the soul, are not those of the truths of life, nor metaphysical
truths. But that pictorial charm which does not depend on any
literary reminiscence for its effect on the one hand, nor is yet a
mere result of communicable technical skill on the other, comes of a
certain inventive and creative handling of colour. Nearly always in
Dutch painting and often in the works of Giorgione or Titian, it is
entirely independent of anything definitely poetical in the subject,
a kind of form and choice in workmanship which is itself entirely
satisfying, and is (as the Greeks would say) an end in itself.
