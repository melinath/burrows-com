<P>Idaho contributed one of the most important buildings for the
Columbian Exposition for its effect on American architecture of the
next generation. The interior furnishings also are major precursors
of the Arts &amp; Crafts furnishing style that found a widespread
appeal in the early 20th century. Visited by an estimated 18 million
people during the summer of 1893, this building and its furnishings
has been largely ignored by scholars of the American Arts &amp;
Crafts Movement.</P>

<CENTER><B>THE STATE BUILDINGS AT THE COLUMBIAN
EXPOSITION</B></CENTER>

<P>The Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, with 27 million
visitors, had a profound influence on American architecture and
decorative arts. While the main buildings were mostly Neo-Classical
in style, the fair committee suggested that the state buildings
represent the style of the American colonies. Many of the state
buildings represented American domestic architecture, and some were
early examples of the Colonial Revival. Some more literally
replicated historic buildings, such as Independence Hall
(Pennsylvania), Washington's Headquarters at Morristown (New Jersey),
the John Hancock House (Massachusetts), and Mt. Vernon (Virginia).
The latter was the most faithful reproduction and was criticized as
lacking the imagination and grace of some of the freely adapted
designs. McKim, Mead &amp; White designed the New York building,
styled after the Villa Medici in Rome, Italy, but it was uniformly
described in the guide books as replicating the "old Van Rensselaer
Mansion" in lower Manhattan, "a great substantial building
&#91;which&#93; recalls the sturdy and ceremonius days of the 'Good
Old Colony Times.'"</P>

<P>One of the largest of the state buildings at the Columbian
Exposition was the California Building by A. Page Brown, designed in
a "Mission" style. This building is credited for helping to link the
ideas of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement with the style of the
southwestern missions in the public mind. A. Page Brown also served
as the architect in 1894 of the Swedenborgian Church of the New
Jerusalem in San Francisco, California. The simple wooden chairs with
rush seats designed for this building are often given credit as the
prototype of American Arts &amp; Crafts furniture (often called
"Mission" furniture), after the design was copied for manufacture in
New York. ("The Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in California: Living the
Good Life," the Oakland Museum, 1993, p. 13 and 58.) The date of the
Swedenborgian Church commission is often used as the starting date of
the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in America, rather than a benchmark of
the maturing of a style that had its roots as early as the
1870's.</P>

<CENTER><B>THE IDAHO BUILDING AND THE ARTS &amp; CRAFTS
MOVEMENT</B></CENTER>

<P>It is surprising that more attention has not already been given by
scholars of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement to the Idaho Building at
the Columbian Exposition. Designed by K.K. Cutter of Spokane,
Washington, the building was compaired to a frontier log cabin, and
to a Swiss chalet, but the strength of the massive log and stone
construction also prefigures many later Arts &amp; Crafts Movement
buildings, including The Log House at Craftsman Farms in Morris
Plains, New Jersey, Gustav Stickley's own home built in 1908 - 1910.
Whether or not Gus Stickley was among the estimated 18 million who
visited the Idaho Pavilion during the Fair in 1893, a man as
interested in architecture and design as Stickley was undoubtedly
aware of this building from photographs in the countless guidebooks
and publications about the Fair.</P>

<P>In "Shepp's World's Fair Photographed" (by James and Daniel Shepp,
Chicago and Philadelphia: Globe Bible Publishing Co., 1893), the
building is described as follows. "The Idaho Building is Colonial in
style, though the territory was unknown when our bathers were early
connected with Great Britain by colonial ties . . .</P>

<P>. . . It is well that the children who come here should see these
rooms. They teach the lesson of the growth of our national
civilization, and how, step by step, men have made their way in life,
as well as something of the costs of the luxuries that we now enjoy.
when the foundations of a nation's civilization are bared before our
eyes, we are apt to judge, with greater acumen, the value of the
superstructure. The foundation, then is here before us, in the cabin
and log hut." (pp 370 - 372)</P>

<P>Of particular interest is the furniture in the Womans Reception
Room that encorporates an eclectic blend of English, German and
Japanese influences, but the heavy construction and the fringed
leather upholstery with heavy tack heads gave an overall Western
feeling that reflected the frontier theme of the building. This
furniture was exhibited before the completion of the Swedenborgian
Church in San Francisco (and seen most likely by A. Page Brown,
architect of the California Building, and perhaps also by Gus
Stickley), and it was widely published in guides to the Fair in
1893.</P>

<P>The Idaho Building, and the furnishings of the Woman's Reception
Room in particular, are noteworthy examples of American Arts &amp;
Crafts Movement design, worthy of further exploration.</P>
