And so in poetry too, the real poetical quality, the .joy of poetry,
comes never from the subject but from an inventive handling of
rhythmical language, from what Keats called the 'sensuous life of
verse.' The element of song in the singing accompanied by the
profound joy of motion, is so sweet that, while the incomplete lives
of ordinary men bring no healing power with them, the thorn-crown of
the poet will blossom into roses for our pleasure; for our delight
his despair will gild its own thorns, and his pain, like Adonis, be
beautiful in its agony; and when the poet's heart breaks it will
break in music.</P>

<P>And health in art--what is that? It has nothing to do with a sane
criticism of life. There is more health in Baudelaire than there is
in &#91;Kingsley&#93;. Health is the artist's recognition of the
limitations of the form in which he works. It is the honour and the
homage which he gives to the material he uses--whether it be language
with its glories, or marble or pigment with their glories--knowing
that the true brotherhood of the arts consists not in their borrowing
one another's method, but in their producing, each of them by its own
individual means, each of them by keeping its objective limits, the
same unique artistic delight. The delight is like that given to us by
music--for music is the art in which form and matter are always one,
the art whose subject cannot be separated from the method of its
expression, the art which most completely realises the artistic
ideal, and is the condition to which all the other arts are
constantly aspiring.</P>

<P>And criticism--what place is that to have in our culture? Well, I
think that the first duty of an art critic is to hold his tongue at
all times, and upon all subjects: <I>C' est un grand avantage de
n'avoir rien fait, mais il ne faut pas, en abuser</I>.</P>

<P>It is only through the mystery of creation that one can gain any
knowledge of the quality of created things. You have listened to
<I>Patience</I> for a hundred nights and you have heard me for one
only. It will make, no doubt, that satire more piquant by knowing
something about the subject of it, but you must not judge of
estheticism by the satire of Mr. Gilbert. As little should you judge
of the strength and splendour of sun or sea by the dust that dances
in the beam, or the bubble that breaks on the wave, as take your
critic for any sane test of art. For the artists, like the Greek
gods, are revealed only to one another, as Emerson says somewhere;
their real value and place time only can show. In this respect also
omnipotence is with the ages. The true critic addresses not the
artist ever but the public only. His work lies with them. Art can
never have any other claim but her own perfection: it is for the
critic to create for art the social aim, too, by teaching the people
the spirit in which they are to approach all artistic work the love
they are to give it, the lesson they are to draw from it.</P>

<P>All these appeals to art to set herself more in harmony with
modern progress and civilisation, and to make herself the mouthpiece
for the voice of humanity, these appeals to art 'to have a mission,'
are appeals which should be made to the public. The art which has
fulfilled the conditions of beauty has fulfilled all conditions: it
is for the critic to teach the people how to find in the calm of such
art the highest expression of their own most stormy passions. 'I have
no reverence,' said Keats, 'for the public, nor for anything in
existence but the Eternal Being, the memory of great men and the
principle of Beauty.'</P>

<P>Such then is the principle which I believe to be guiding and
underlying our English Renaissance, a Renaissance many-sided and
wonderful, productive of strong ambitions and lofty personalties, yet
for all its splendid achievements in poetry and in the decorative
arts and in painting, for all the increased comeliness and grace of
dress, and the furniture of houses and the like, not complete. For
there can be no great sculpture without a beautiful national life,
and the commercial spirit of England has killed that; no great drama
without a noble national life, and the commercial spirit of England
has killed that too.</P>

<P>It is not that the flawless serenity of marble cannot bear the
burden of the modern intellectual spirit, or become instinct with the
fire of romantic passion--the tomb of Duke Lorenzo and the chapel of
the Medici show us that - but it is that, as Th&eacute;ophile Gautier
used to say, the visible world is dead, <I>le monde visible a
disparu.</I></P>

<P>Nor is it again that the novel has killed the play, us some
critics would persuade us--the romantic movement of France shows us
that. The work of Balzac and of Hugo grew up side by side together;
nay, more, were complementary, to each other, though neither of them
saw it. While all other forms of poetry may flourish in an ignoble
age, the splendid individualism of the lyrist, fed by its own
passion, and lit by its own power, may pass as a pillar of fire as
well across the desert as across places that are pleasant. It is none
the less glorious though no man follow it--nay, by the greater
sublimity of its loneliness it may be quickened into loftier
utterance and intensified into clearer song. From the mean squalor of
the sordid life that limits him, the dreamer or the idyllist may soar
on poesy's viewless wings, may traverse with fawn-skin and spear the
moonlit heights of Cithaeron though Faun and Bassarid dance there no
more. Like Keats he may wander through the old world forests of
Latmos, or stand like Morris on the galley's deck with the Viking
when king and galley have long since passed away. But the drama is
the meeting-plate of art and life; it deals, as Mazzini said, Dot
merely with man, but with social man, with man in his relation to God
and to Humanity. It is the product of a period of great national
united energy; it is impossible without a noble public, and belongs
to such ages as the age of Elizabeth in London and of Pericles at
Athens; it is part of such lofty moral and spiritual ardour as came
to Greek after the defeat of the Persian fleet, and to Englishman
after the wreck of the Armada of Spain.</P>

<P>Shelley felt how incomplete our movement was in this respect, and
has shown in one great tragedy by what terror and pity he would have
purified our age; but in spite of <I>The Cenci</I> the drama is one
of the artistic forms through which the genius of the England of this
century seeks in vain to find outlet and expression. He has had no
worthy imitators.</P>

<P>It is rather, perhaps, to you that we should turn to complete and
perfect this great movement of ours, for there is something Hellenic
in your air and world, something that has a quicker breath of the joy
and power of Elizabeth's England about it than our ancient
civilisation can give us. For you, at least, are young; 'no hungry
generations tread you down,' and the past does not weary you with the
intolerable burden of its memories nor mock you with the ruins of a
beauty, the secret of whose creation you have lost. That very absence
of tradition, which Mr. Ruskin thought would rob your rivers of their
laughter and your flowers of their light, may be rather the source of
your freedom and your strength.</P>

<P>To speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance
of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the
sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside, has been
defined by one of your poets as a flawless triumph of art. It is a
triumph which you above all nations may be destined to achieve. For
the voices that have their dwelling in sea and mountain are not the
chosen music of Liberty only; other messages are there in the wonder
of wind-swept height and the majesty of silent deep messages that, if
you will but listen to them, may yield you the splendour of some new
imagination, the marvel of some new beauty.</P>

<P>'I foresee,' said Goethe, 'the dawn of a new literature which all
people may claim as their own, for all have contributed to its
foundation.' If, then, this is so, and if the materials for a
civilisation as great as that of Europe lie all around you, what
profit, you will ask me, will all this study of our poets and
painters be to you? I might answer that the intellect can be engaged
without direct didactic object on an artistic and historical problem;
that the demand of the intellect is merely to feel itself alive; that
nothing which has ever interested men or women can cease to be a fit
subject for culture.</P>

<P>I might remind you of what all Europe owes to the sorrow of a
single Florentine in exile at Verona, or to the love of Petrarch by
that little well in Southern France; nay, more, how even in this
dull, materialistic age the simple expression of an old man's simple
life, passed away from the clamour of great cities amid the lakes and
misty hills of Cumberland, has opened out for England treasures of
new joy compared with which the treasures of her luxury are as barren
as the sea which she has made her highway, and as bitter as the fire
which she would make her slave.</P>

<P>But I think it will bring you something besides this, something
that is the knowledge of real strength in art: not that you should
imitate the works of these men; but their artistic spirit their
artistic attitude, I think you should absorb that.</P>

<P>For in nations, as in individuals, if the passion for creation be
not accompanied by the critical, the aesthetic faculty also, it will
be sure to waste its strength aimlessly, failing perhaps in the
artistic spirit of choice, or in the mistaking of feeling for form,
or in the following of false ideals.</P>

<P>For the various spiritual forms of the imagination have a natural
affinity with certain sensuous forms of art--and to discern the
qualities of each art, to intensify as well its limitations as its
powers of expression, is one of the aims that culture sets before us.
It is not an increased moral sense, an increased moral supervision
that your literature needs. Indeed, one should never talk of a moral
or an immoral poem--poems are either well written or badly written,
that is all. And, indeed, any element of morals or implied reference
to a standard of good or evil in art is often a sign of a certain
incompleteness of vision, often a note of discord in the harmony of
au imaginative creation; for all good work aims at a purely artistic
effect. 'We must be careful, said Goethe, 'not to be always looking
for culture merely in what is obviously moral. Everything that is
great promotes civilisation as soon as we are aware of it.</P>

<P>But, as in your cities so in your literature, it is a permanent
canon and standard of taste, an increased sensibility to beauty (if I
may say so) that is lacking. All noble work is not national merely,
but universal. The political independence of a nation must not be
confused with any intellectual isolation. The spiritual freedom,
indeed, your own generous lives and liberal air will give you. From
us you will learn the classical restraint of form.
