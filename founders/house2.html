The fault which I have observed in most of your rooms is that there
is apparent no definite scheme of colour. Everything is not attuned
to a key-note as it should be. The apartments are crowded with pretty
things which have no relation to one another. Again, your artists
must decorate what is more simply useful. In your art schools I found
no attempt to decorate such things as the vessels for water. I know
of nothing uglier than the ordinary jug or pitcher. A museum could be
filled with the different kinds of water vessels which are used in
hot countries. Yet we continue to submit to the depressing jug with
the handle all on one side. I do not see the wisdom of decorating
dinner-plates with sunsets and soup-plates with moonlight scenes. I
do not think it adds anything to the pleasure of the canvas-back duck
to take it out of such glories. Besides, we do not want a soup-plate
whose bottom seems to vanish in the distance. One feels neither safe
nor comfortable under such conditions. In fact, I did not find in the
art schools of the country that the difference was explained between
decorative and imaginative art.</P>

<P>The conditions of art should be simple. A great deal more depends
upon the heart than upon the head. Appreciation of art is not secured
by any elaborate scheme of learning. Art requires a good healthy
atmosphere. The motives for art are still around about us as they
were round about the ancients. And the subjects are also easily found
by the earnest sculptor and the painter. Nothing is more picturesque
and graceful than a man at work The artist who goes to the children's
play ground, watches them at their sport and sees the boy stoop to
tie his shoe, will find the same themes that engaged the attention of
the ancient Greeks, and such observation and the illustrations which
follow will do much to correct that foolish impression that mental
and physical beauty are always divorced.</P>

<P>To you, more than perhaps to any other country, has Nature been
generous in furnishing material for art workers to work in. You have
marble quarries where the stone is more beautiful in colour than any
the Greeks ever had for their beautiful work, and yet day after day I
am confronted with the great building of some stupid man who has used
the beautiful material as if it were not precious almost beyond
speech. Marble should not be used save by noble workmen. There is
nothing which gave me a greater sense of barrenness in travelling
through the country than the entire absence of wood carving on your
houses. Wood carving is the simplest of the decorative arts. In
Switzerland the little barefooted boy beautifies the porch of his
father's house with examples of skill in this direction. Why should
not American boys do a great deal more and better than Swiss
boys?</P>

<P>There is nothing to my mind more coarse in conception and more
vulgar in execution than modern jewellery. This is something that can
easily be corrected. Something better should be made out of the
beautiful gold which is stored up in your mountain hollows and strewn
along your river beds. When I was at Leadville and reflected that all
the shining silver that I saw coming from the mines would be made
into ugly dollars, it made me sad. It should be made into something
more permanent. The golden gates at Florence are as beautiful to-day
as when Michael Angelo saw them.</P>

<P>We should see more of the workman than we do. We should not be
content to have the salesman stand between us--the salesman who knows
nothing of what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal
too much for it. And watching the workman will teach that most
important lesson--the nobility of all rational workmanship.</P>

<P>I said in my last lecture that art would create a new brotherhood
among men by furnishing a universal language. I said that under its
beneficent influences war might pass away. Thinking this, what place
can I ascribe to art in our education? If children grow up Among all
fair and lovely things, they will grow to love beauty and detest
ugliness before they know the reason why. If you go into a house
where everything is coarse, you find things chipped and broken and
unsightly. Nobody exercises any care. If every thing is dainty and
delicate, gentleness and refinement of manner are unconsciously
acquired. When I was in San Francisco I used to visit the Chinese
Quarter frequently. There I used to watch a great hulking Chinese
workman at his task of digging, and used to see him every day drink
his tea from a little cup as delicate in texture as the petal of a
flower, whereas in all the grand hotels of the land, where thousands
of dollars have been lavished on great gilt mirrors and gaudy
columns, I have been given my coffee or my chocolate in cups an inch
and a quarter thick. I think I have deserved something nicer.</P>

<P>The art systems of the past have been devised by philosophers who
looked upon human beings as obstructions. They have tried to educate
boys' minds before they had any. How much better it would be in these
early years to teach children to use their hands in the rational
service of mankind. I would have a workshop attached to every school,
and one hour a day given up to the teaching of simple decorative
arts. It would be a golden hour to the children. And you would soon
raise up a race of handicraftsmen who would transform the face of
your country. I have seen only one such school in the United States,
and this was in Philadelphia and was founded by my friend Mr.
Leyland. I stopped there yesterday and have brought some of the work
here this afternoon to show you. Here are two disks of beaten brass:
the designs on them are beautiful, the workmanship is simple, and the
entire result is satisfactory. The work was done by a little boy
twelve years old. This is a wooden bowl decorated by a little girl of
thirteen. The design is lovely and the colouring delicate and pretty.
Here you see a piece of beautiful wood carving accomplished by a
little boy of nine. In such work as this, children learn sincerity in
art. They learn to abhor the liar in art--the man who paints wood to
look like iron, or iron to look like stone. It is a practical school
of morals. No better way is there to learn to love Nature than to
understand Art. It dignifies every flower of the field. And, the boy
who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wing becomes when
transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throw the customary
stone. What we want is something spiritual added to life. Nothing is
so ignoble that Art cannot sanctify it.</P>
