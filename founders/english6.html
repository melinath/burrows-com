<HR>

For all great art is delicate art, roughness having very little to do
with strength, and harshness very little to do with power. 'The
artist,' as Mr. Swinburne says, 'must be perfectly articulate.'</P>

<P>This limitation is for the artist perfect freedom: it is at once
the origin and the sign of his strength. So that all the supreme
masters of style--Dante, Sophocles, Shakespeare--are the supreme
masters of spiritual and intellectual vision also.</P>

<P>Love art for its own sake, and then all things that you need will
be added to you.</P>

<P>This devotion to beauty and to the creation of beautiful things is
the test of all great civilised nations. Philosophy may teach us to
bear with equanimity the misfortunes of our neighbours, and science
resolve the moral sense into a secretion of sugar, but art is what
makes the life of each citizen a sacrament and not a speculation, art
is what makes the life of the whole race immortal.</P>

<P>For beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm. Philosophies
fall away like sand, and creeds follow one another like the withered
leaves of autumn; but what is beautiful is a joy for all seasons and
a possession for all eternity.</P>

<P>Wars and the clash of armies and the meeting of men in battle by
trampled field or leaguered city, and the rising of nations there
must always be. But I think that art, by creating a common
intellectual atmosphere between all countries, might--if it could not
overshadow the world with the silver wings of peace--at least make
men such brothers that they would not go out to slay one another for
the whim or folly of some king or minister, as they do in Europe.
Fraternity would come no more with the hands of Cain, nor Liberty
betray freedom with the kiss of Anarchy; for national hatreds are
always strongest where culture is lowest.</P>

<P>'How could I?' said Goethe, when reproached for not writing like
K&ouml;rner against the French. 'How could 1, to whom barbarism and
culture alone are of importance, hate a nation which is among the
most cultivated of the earth, a nation to which I owe a great part of
my own cultivation?'</P>

<P>Mighty empires, too, there must always be as long as personal
ambition and the spirit of the age are one, but art at least is the
only empire which a nation's enemies cannot take from her by
conquest, but which is taken by submission only. The sovereignty of
Greece and Rome is not yet passed away, though the gods of the one be
dead and the eagles of the other tired.</P>

<P>And we in our Renaissance are seeking to create a sovereignty that
will still be England's when her yellow leopards have grown weary of
wars and the rose of her shield is crimsoned no more with the blood
of battle; and you, too, absorbing into the generous heart of a great
people this pervading artistic spirit, will create for yourselves
such riches as you have never yet created, though your land be a
network of railways and your cities the harbours for the galleys of
the world.</P>

<P>I know, indeed, that the divine natural pre-science of beauty
which is the inalienable inheritance of Greek and Italian is not our
inheritance. For such an informing and presiding spirit of art to
shield us from all harsh and alien influences, we of the Northern
races must turn rather to that strained self-consciousness of our age
which, as it is the key-note of all our romantic art, must be the
source of all or nearly all our culture. I mean that intellectual
curiosity of the nineteenth century which is always looking for the
secret of the life that still lingers round old and bygone forms of
culture. It takes from each what is serviceable for the modern spirit
--from Athens its wonder without its worship, from Venice its
splendour without its sin. The same spirit is always analysing its
own strength and its own weakness, counting what it owes to East and
to West, to the olive-trees of Colonus and to the palm-trees of
Lebanon, to Gethsemane and to the garden of Proserpine.</P>

<P>And yet the truths of art cannot be taught: they are revealed
only, revealed to natures which have made themselves receptive of all
beautiful impressions by the study and worship of all beautiful
things. And hence the enormous importance given to the decorative
arts in our English Renaissance; hence all that marvel of design that
comes from the hand of Edward Burne-Jones, all that weaving of
tapestry and staining of glass, that beautiful working in clay and
metal and wood which we owe to William Morris, the greatest
handicraftsmen we have had in England since the fourteenth
century.</P>

<P>So, in years to come there will be nothing in any man's house
which has not given delight to its maker And does not give delight to
its user. The children, like the children of Plato's perfect city,
will grow up 'in a simple atmosphere of all fair things'--I quote
from the passage in the <I>Republic</I> - 'a simple atmosphere of all
fair things, where beauty, which is the spirit of art, will come on
eye and ear like a fresh breath of wind that brings health from a
clear upland, and insensibly and gradually draw the child's soul into
harmony with all knowledge and all wisdom, so that he will love what
is beautiful and good, and hate what is evil and ugly (for they
always go together) long before he knows the reason why; and then
when reason comes will kiss her on the cheek as a friend.'</P>
