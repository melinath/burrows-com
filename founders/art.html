PEOPLE often talk as if there was an opposition between what is
beautiful and what is useful. There is no opposition to beauty except
ugliness: all things are either beautiful or ugly, and utility will
be always on the side of the beautiful thing, because beautiful
decoration is always on the side of the beautiful thing, because
beautiful decoration is always an expression of the use you put a
thing to and the value placed on it. No workman will beautifully
decorate bad work, nor can you possibly get good handicraftsmen or
workmen without having beautiful designs. You should be quite sure of
that. If you have poor and worthless designs in any craft or trade
you will get poor and worthless workmen only, but the minute you have
noble and beautiful designs, then you get men of power and intellect
and feeling to work for you. By having good designs you have workmen
who work not merely with their hands but with their hearts and heads
too; otherwise you will get merely the fool or the loafer to worn for
you.</P>

<P>That the beauty of life is a thing of no moment, I suppose few
people would venture to assert. And yet most civilised people act as
if it were of none, and in so doing are wronging both themselves and
those that are to come after them. For that beauty which is meant by
art is no mere accident of human life which people can take or leave,
but a positive necessity of life if we are to live as nature meant us
to, that is to say unless we are content to be less than men.</P>

<P>Do not think that the commercial spirit which is the basis of your
life and cities here is opposed to art. Who built the beautiful
cities of the world but commercial men and commercial men only? Genoa
built by its traders, Florence by its bankers, and Venice, most
lovely of all, by its noble and honest merchants.</P>

<P>I do not wish you, remember, 'to build a new Pisa,' nor to bring
'the life or the decorations of the thirteenth century back again.'
'The circumstances with which you must surround your workmen are
those' of modern American life, 'because the designs you have now to
ask for from your workmen are such as will make modern' American
'life beautiful.' The art we want is the art based on all the
inventions of modern civilisation, and to suit all the needs of
nineteenth-century life.</P>

<P>Do you think, for instance, that we object to machinery? I tell
you we reverence it; we reverence it when it does its proper work,
when it relieves man from ignoble and soulless labour, not when it
seeks to do that which is valuable only when wrought by the hands and
hearts of men. Let us have no machine-made ornament at all; it is all
bad and worthless and ugly. And let us not mistake the means of
civilisation for the end of civilisation; steam-engine, telephone and
the like, are all wonderful, but remember that their value depends
entirely on the noble uses we make of them, on the noble spirit in
which we employ them, not on the things themselves.</P>

<P>It is, no doubt, a great advantage to talk to a man at the
Antipodes through a telephone; its advantage depends entirely on the
value of what the two men have to say to one another. If one merely
shrieks slander through a tube and the other whispers folly into a
wire, do not think that anybody is very much benefited by the
invention.</P>

<P>The train that whirls an ordinary Englishman through Italy at the
rate of forty miles an hour and finally sends him home without any
memory of that lovely country but that he was cheated by a courier at
Rome, or that he got a bad dinner at Verona, does not do him or
civilisation much good. But that swift legion of fiery-footed engines
that bore to the burning ruins of Chicago the loving help and
generous treasure of the world was as noble and as beautiful as any
golden troop of angels that ever fed the hungry and clothed the naked
in the antique times. As beautiful, yes; all machinery may be
beautiful when it is undecorated even. Do not seek to decorate it. We
cannot but think all good machinery is graceful, also, the line of
strength and the line of beauty being one.</P>

<P>Give then, as I said, to your workmen of to-day the bright and
noble surroundings that you can yourself create. Stately and simple
architecture for your cities, bright and simple dress for your men
and women; those are the conditions of a real artistic movement. For
the artist is not concerned primarily with any theory of life but
with life itself, with the joy and loveliness that should come daily
on eye and ear for a beautiful external world.</P>

<P>But the simplicity must not be barrenness nor the bright colour
gaudy. For all beautiful colours are graduated colours, the colours
that seem about to pass into one another's realm-- colour without
tone being like music without harmony, mere discord. Barren
architecture, the vulgar and glaring advertisements that desecrate
not merely your cities but every rock and river that I have seen yet
in America - all this is not enough. A school of design we must have
too in each city. It should be a stately and noble building, full of
the best examples of the best art of the world. Furthermore, do not
put your designers in a barren whitewashed room and bid them work in
that depressing and colourless atmosphere as I have seen many of the
American schools of design, but give them beautiful surroundings.
Because you want to produce a permanent canon and standard of taste
in your workman, he must have always by him and before him specimens
of the best decorative art of the world, so that you can say to him:
'This is good work. Greek or Italian or Japanese wrought it so many
years ago, but it is eternally young because eternally beautiful.'
Work in this spirit and you will be sure to be right. Do not copy it,
but work with the same love, the same reverence, the same freedom of
imagination. You must teach him colour and design, how all beautiful
colours are graduated colours and glaring colours the essence of
vulgarity. Show him the quality of any beautiful work of nature like
the rose, or any beautiful work of art like an Eastern carpet-- being
merely the exquisite gradation of colour, one tone answering another
like the answering chords of a symphony. Teach him how the true
designer is not he who makes the design and then colours it, but he
who designs in colour, creates in colour, thinks in colour too. Show
him how the most gorgeous stained-glass windows of Europe are filled
with white glass, and the most gorgeous Eastern tapestry with toned
colours--the primary colours in both places being set in the white
glass, and the tone colours line brilliant jewels set in dusky gold.
And then as regards design, show him how the real designer will take
first any given limited space, little disk of silver, it may be, like
a Greek coin, or wide expanse of fretted ceiling or lordly wall as
Tintoret chose at Venice (it does not matter which), and to this
limited space--the first condition of decoration being the limitation
of the size of the material used-- he will give the effect of its
being filled with beautiful decoration, filled with it as a golden
cup will be filled with wine, so complete that you should not be able
to take away anything from it or add anything to it. For from a good
piece of design you can take away nothing, nor can you add anything
to it, each little bit of design being as absolutely necessary and as
vitally important to the whole effect as a note or chord of music is
for a sonata of Beethoven.</P>

<P>But I said the effect of its being so filled. because this, again,
is of the essence of good design. With a simple spray of leaves and a
bird in flight a Japanese artist will give you the impression that he
has completely covered with lovely design the reed fan or lacquer
cabinet at which he is working, merely because he knows the exact
spot in which to place them. All good design depends on the texture
of the utensil used and the use you wish to put it to. One of the
first things I saw in an American school of design was a young lady
painting a romantic moonlight landscape on a large round dish, and
another young lady covering a set of dinner plates with a series of
sunsets of the most remarkable colours. Let your ladies paint
moonlight landscapes and sunsets, but do not let them paint them on
dinner plates or dishes. Let them take canvas or paper for such work,
but not clay or china. They are merely painting the wrong subjects on
the wrong material, that is all. They have not been taught that every
material and texture has certain qualities of its own. The design
suitable for one is quite wrong for the other, just as the design
which you should work on a flat table-cover ought to be quite
different from the design you would work on a curtain, for the one
will always be straight, the other broken into folds; and the use too
one puts the object to should guide one in the choice of design. One
does not want to eat one's terrapins off a romantic moonlight nor
one's clams off a harrowing sunset. Glory of sun and moon, let them
be wrought for us by our landscape artist and be on the walls of the
rooms we sit in to remind us of the undying beauty of the sunsets
that fade and die, but do not let us eat our soup off them and send
them down to the kitchen twice a day to be washed and scrubbed by the
handmaid.</P>

<P>All these things are simple enough, yet nearly always forgotten.
Your school of design here will teach your girls and your boys, your
handi-craftsmen of the future (for all your schools of art should be
local schools, the schools of particular cities). We talk of the
Italian school of painting, but there is no Italian school; there
were the schools of each city. Every town in Italy, from Venice
itself, queen of the sea, to the little hill fortress of Perugia,
each had its own school of art, each different and all beautiful.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>So do not mind what art Philadelphia or New York is having, but
make by the hands of your own citizens beautiful art for the joy of
your own citizens, for you have here the primary elements of a great
artistic movement.</P>

<P>For, believe me, the conditions of art are much simpler than
people imagine. For the noblest art one requires a clear healthy
atmosphere, not polluted as the air of our English cities is by the
smoke and grime and horridness which comes from open furnace and from
factory chimney. You must have strong, sane, healthy physique among
your men and women. Sickly or idle or melancholy people do not do
much in art. And lastly, you require a sense of individualism about
each man and woman, for this is the essence of art a desire on the
part of man to express himself in the noblest way possible. And this
is the reason that the grandest art of the world always came from a
republic: Athens, Venice, and Florence--there were no kings there and
so their art was as noble and simple as sincere. But if you want to
know what kind of art the folly of kings will impose on a country
look at the decorative art of France under the great <I>monarque</I>,
under Louis the Fourteenth; the gaudy gilt furniture writhing under a
sense of its own horror and ugliness, with a nymph smirking at every
angle and a dragon mouthing on every claw. Unreal and monstrous art
this, and fit only for such periwigged pomposities as the nobility of
France at that time, but not at all fit for you or me. We do not want
the rich to possess more beautiful things but the poor to create more
beautiful things; for ever man is poor who cannot create. Nor shall
the art which you and I need be merely a purple robe woven by a slave
and thrown over the whitened body of some leprous king to adorn or to
conceal the sin of his luxury, but rather shall it be the noble and
beautiful expression of a people's noble and beautiful life. Art
shall be again the most glorious of all the chords through which the
spirit of a great nation finds its noblest utterance.</P>

<P>All around you, I said, lie the conditions for a great artistic
movement for every great art. Let us think of one of them; a
sculptor, for instance.</P>

<P>If a modern sculptor were to come and say, 'Very well, but where
can one find subjects for sculpture out of men who wear frock-coats
and chimney-pot hats?' I would tell him to go to the docks of a great
city and watch the men loading or unloading the stately ships,
working at wheel or windlass, hauling at rope or gangway. I have
never watched a man do anything useful who has not been graceful at
some moment of his labour: it is only the loafer and the idle
saunterer who is as useless and uninteresting to the artist as he is
to himself. I would ask the sculptor to go with me to any of your
schools or universities, to the running ground and gymnasium, to
watch the young men start for a race, hurling quoit or club, kneeling
to tie their shoes before leaping, stepping from the boat or bending
to the oar, and to carve them; and when he was weary of cities I
would ask him to come to your fields and meadows to watch the reaper
with his sickle and the cattle-driver with lifted lasso. For if a man
cannot find the noblest motives for his art in such simple daily
things as a woman drawing water from the well or a man leaning with
his scythe, he will not find them anywhere at all. Gods and goddesses
the Greek carved because he loved them; saint and king the Goth
because he believed in them. But you, you do not care much for Greek
gods and goddesses, and you are perfectly and entirely right; and you
do not think much of kings either, and you are quite right. But what
you do love are your own men and women, your own flowers and fields,
your own hills and mountains, and these are what your art should
represent to you.</P>
