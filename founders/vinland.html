<P>The Preservation Society of Newport County, in Newport, Rhode
Island, has an album of clippings regarding the decoration of
"Vinland," a country house on the ocean (or "cottage" as they were
called in Newport) that was designed for Miss Catharine Wolfe around
the theme of the Viking settlement of North America. Local legend was
that a circular stone tower in Newport was built by Vikings (this is
not accepted by modern archaeologists, who think the tower might have
been built as a windmill by English colonists). Longfellow wrote a
poem called "The Skeleton in Armor" about the Newport Vikings, and
this served as the inspiration for the architectural design and
decorations of the house.</P>

<P>The first letter from Morris was apparently written to the
decorator, identified in the newspapers as "Codman, of Boston"
(addressed as "Dear Sir" and not directly to Miss Wolfe) and is dated
Merton Abbey, Surrey, April 11th, 1883. Morris discusses appropriate
figures from the old Norse sagas for the windows, which were to be
drawn by Burne-Jones.</P>

<P>Dear Sir:</P>

<P>I have been talking over the matter of Miss Wolfes window with Mr.
Burne-Jones, and he quite agrees to the sort of subjects. On reading
over the sagas again, I find that Ericke Rau_i &#91;Erick the
Red&#93; was never in America, and that all the people who had to do
with Vinland Thofinn Karlsefne seemed to be closes connected with it:
I should suggest the representing of him and his wife Gudridr instead
of the old man and Freydis: which latter was a horrible wretch
according to the Leifs' saga whereas Gudridr has something pleasing
and womanly about her. It is true that in Thofinn Karsefnes' saga
Freydis is softened into a courageous amazon; but that story is
visibly untrustworthy compared with that of Lief Heppin and is very
late in composition. I propose Odin Thor and Frey the 3 great Gods
above the adventurers of Vinland; &amp; in the small lights, a ship
the middle, &amp; on each side a scroll, with the passages from
H&aacute;vam&aacute;l (Edda) about undying fame on it: proper enough
on this occasion since the poor fishermen &amp; sheep farmers of
Greenland &amp; Iceland have so curiously found a place among the
worthies connected with the great modern commonwealth
&#91;America&#93;. Over leaf I make a diagram of the window.</P>

<P>May I ask as a matter of business if we may consider the window
ordered and go on with it: I am vexed that any delay sould have taken
place, but it has not been owing to any neglect of ours.</P>

<P ALIGN=right>I am<BR>
Dear sir<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
William Morris</P>

<P>A second letter of 1885 to Miss Catharine Wolfe was written in
reply to inquiries about the text of the inscriptions.</P>

<P>Dear Madam,</P>

<P>The two inscriptions on the scrolls are translations from the
passages in H&aacute;v&aacute;mal beginning Deyr f&eacute; Deyr
fraendr &amp;tc. &#91;This stanza reads in English: Cattle die,
kinsfolk die, even to us ourselves will death come. But the good fame
which a man has won for himself will never die.&#93; The translation
of course is mine, and is necessarily a little free. I think one
translator translates f&eacute; by cante: this is absurd although it
is the primary meaning like pecinnia in Latin.</P>

<P>The inscriptions to the Gods are out of my own head.</P>

<P>Gudrinn is holding a rune-staff because in the Thorfinns saga in
the part about the 'little vala' it says that Gudrinn was wise in
ancient lore and incantation (sei_i-frie_r). The background to the
heroes is a conventional representation of the sea.</P>

<P>The inscription on Gudrinns' rune-staff is only pictorial &amp;
can't be read. I believe we can have photos of the designs on a small
scale; we will send them to you if they can be got.</P>

<P>I am very pleased that you approve of the window: The musical
personages make it specially interesting to us.</P>

<P>Thank you for your kind invitation, but I fear I am not likely to
be able to get so long a holiday as would carry me to America for a
long while - longer than I can look forward to.</P>

<P>Newspaper Clipping in Miss Catherine L. Wolfe's scrapbook:</P>

<P>Walter Crane is the subject of the principal illustrated article
in the November number of the Art Amateur. Among the drawings is a
full page reproduction of the artist's sketch of his painting "The
Angel of Love Arresting the Hand of Fate," an autograph portrait and
a number of reproductions of illustrations. A notable supplement to
the number is Longfellow's "The Skeleton in Armor," accompanied by a
series of drawings, by Mr. Crane, after his frieze in illustration of
that poem, which is one of the decorations in the recently completed
Newport residence of that liberal and enlightened patron of Art, Miss
Catherine Wolfe.</P>

<P>My Dear Madam,</P>

<P>Many thanks for your kind note received to-day.</P>

<P>I am glad that you have been able to re-consider your objection to
the sketches of the frieze appearing, as it will save disappointment
in more than one quarter.</P>

<P>The editor of the 'Art Amateur' whom I met at Sir Fredk.
Leighton's here in London, was anzious to make the account of my work
he proposed to publish as complete a representative as was possible,
he, having regard to his public, was particularly desirous of
obtaining sketches of the frieze I have executed for you &amp; as not
only being an important work in itself, but interesting also as being
destined for an American home.</P>

<P>I saw Dr. Norris here the other day, &amp; he has intrusted me

you at once to visit my studio - but I am so preped with work still
to be finished for the Grosvenor Gallery that I have no time free

<P>Would it be convenient to you to call here about 3 o'clock on

<CENTER>LEDGER AND TRANSCRIPT.

<P>Philadelphia, Wednesday, Sep, 26, 1883,</P>

<P><B>A VIKING'S SUCCESSOR</B></P></CENTER>

<P>The New York Evening Post of the 18th inst. gives a full
description of "Vinland," the house just built at Newport for Miss
Catharine L. Wolfe, of New York. It reads like a fairy story. The old
"Stone Mill" in Newport is often spoken of as a Tower built by the
Norsemen, who, it is said, in the Ninth Century sailed westward and
found and settled on the New England coast, and Vinland is the name
given to the colony supposed to have left the old Stone Mill as one
of its heirlooms. Longfellow was riding one day on the sands at
Newport, thinking over a story, then recent, of the discovery not far
off of a skeleton in armor. With a poet's true instinct, he made the
subject the basis of his well-known poem, "The Skeleton in Armor,"
and his story was that of a Viking who loved a Prince's daughter,
and, having been scoffingly rejected by the father, fled with the
daughter across the open ocean, landed in Vinland, there built the
stone tower for his bride, and on her death fell on his own sword.
When Miss Wolfe determined to build her new house she remembered the
poem and determined to make her home one that, in stone and wood, in
glass and fresco painting, should recall the old story. Her
architects seconded her plan. Her house is a long, low, dark red
stone structure, made thoroughly comfortable by broad porches and
broad terrace walks, while all the carving suggests the vines, leaves
and fruit and the foliage that befit the name of Vinland. Indoors,
too, both in construction and ornament, the house is full of the old
legend. Codman, of Boston, is an artist in feeling and a man of
education, fully able to execute the task entrusted to him. With
Peabody and Stearns, the architects, he made the house tell its
story, and secured the assistance of artists all full of zeal and
ability.</P>

<P>William Morris, of London, is known as a poet who has rewritten
the old Norse legends, and as a practical house furnisher who has
made a study of applying art to the daily requirements of life
indoors. He has supplied much of the material that makes</P>

<P>Vinland a comfortable home, but he has done more than that, for he
has enlisted in the work of its decoration artists of acknowledged
pre-eminence. Burne Jones, the famous aesthetic painter, is hard at
work on a great glass window, in which the heroes and heroines of the
old Norse legend of Vinland, and their ship, are to stand in glowing
colors. Walter Crane, the popular painter and designer, who has
revolutionized the whole world of children's picture books, has
painted a frieze in which he illustrates with wonderful beauty, vigor
and coloring the story of Longfellow's Skeleton in Armor; and, last
scene of all, the Old Stone Tower stands up, as the artist fancies it
must have looked those long centuries ago. The same quaint legend has
its suggestion in the carving, both in stone and wood, of chimney
pieces, columns, arches, windows, and all the constructive and
ornamental parts of the house that require or admitted such a method
of pointing out the origin of the name chosen, Vinland. The house is
described as well placed in a large stretch of ground, bounded by the
sea, and the famous "cliff walk" kept open for the public, while
Bowditch, the well-known Boston landscape gardener, has preserved the
trees of the old farm that once occupied the site, and added others
brought from the new owner's own paternal homestead, and has made the
whole a setting of lawn and garden well suited to the house, which
will in time stand in the midst of a wealth of foliage, suggesting
the name "Vinland," and the story of the old Norsemen of
Longfellow.</P>

&#91;New York, 1883&#93;</P></CENTER>

<P>NEWPORT, September 15. - The wide gates of Miss Wolfe's Newport
house, just completed, were opened to-day for the first time, and her
large circle of friends were hospitably welcomed within its walls.
The house stands upon Ochre Point, on the site of the old Lawrence
mansion, a plain, old-fashioned wooden house, noted for the long
ownership and occupancy of ex-Governor William Beach Lawrence, where
a succession of distinguished visitors were entertained during the
forty years of his busy literary life. After his death his library
was sold, his manuscripts scattered, and his household effects
distributed among his family. His farm, for such it was when he
bought it, and it remained plain and unimproved in his hands, was cut
up, and on the lots first sold are built the fine houses of Mr.
Lorillard, Mr. Walter Lewis, Mr. Fairman Rogers, and half a dozen
other modern villas in a curious medley of architecture. &#91;This
includes "Ochre Court" - a French Chateau by Richard Morris Hunt, and
"Wakehurst," an exact copy of Wakehurst Place near Standen in Sussex,
that occupies a large house lot across the street from
"Vinland."&#93; Miss Wolfe's house is a large, long, low red-stone
house, in the midst of a large plot of ground that has been converted
into a beautiful pleasaunce, rich in great beds of ribbon gardening,
with some fine old trees and plantations intended to shelter the
lawns. The house itself was designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns,
architects of Boston, and much of the constructive and ornamental
work within was executed under their direction.</P>

<CENTER><B>THE NAME AND NATURE OF THE HOUSE.</B></CENTER>

<P>The name of Vinland typifies the story that is told by the house
itself, and by the decorative work that makes it a treasure-house of
art. It is named after the first spot on which the old Norsemen are
supposed to have landed on their prehistoric voyage across the ocean.
The house is a modern, modified, and subdued Norseman (or Norman)
building, with an entrance gate of great square columns. A broad
porte-cochere, with richly carved capitals upon the sides, opens by a
wide doorway, across a pavement of mosaic work in low colors, into
the main hall. The ceiling is an arched roof of dark lustrous color,
and the light is given mainly by a great window at the head of a
generous stairway, to be filled by a glass window now in course of
construction from designs by Mr. Burne Jones.</P>

<P>The story told by Longfellow in his well known poem of "The
Skeleton in Armor" is the keynote of the house and its decoration,
and Vinland is well chosen as the name of a house in which the old
Norse legends are told in frescoes by Walter Crane and painted glass
with subjects selected by William Morris from the Norse sagas. The
frieze executed by Walter Crane is an artist's rendering of
Longfellow's heroic verse. The designs in much of the woodwork, both
constructive and ornamental, recall the Runic or Northern art seen in
not a few Northern buildings, and even the Venetian mosaic work, used
freely and effectively, suggests the debt of the Italian mediaeval
artists to the early Northmen. Morris reread the sagas, and chose for
subjects the heroes and heroines who figure in the legendary voyage
to Vinland.</P>

<P>Even the woodwork of the railing and newel of the staircase
leading up to the foot of the great window, and the gallery opening
into the rooms above, are carved in Runic and Norse designs, relieved
by vines and clustering leaves and grapes. In the dining-room, at the
foot of the broad staircase, the frieze is a series of frescoes by
Walter Crane, illustrating in successive pictures the story of
Longfellow's Viking, his wooing of the blue-eyed maid, Hildebrand's
scornful rejection of his suit -</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"She was a Prince's child,<BR>
   I but a Viking wild;<BR>
   And though she blushed and smiled,<BR>
   I was discarded.
   
   <P>Then the flight of the lovers, the pursuit, the sinking of the
   ship, with the father and his twenty comrades, the safe arrival of
   the pair on land, where the Viking built</P>
   
   <P>"the lofty tower,<BR>
   Which to this very hour,<BR>
   Stands looking seaward,"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and the old stone mill stands forth with renewed honor in this
cycle of the old Norse legend, while the last scene represents the
death of the heroine and finally of the hero. Even the red sandstone
of the fireplace and mantel is inscribed with the names of the great
Norse heroes, who figure in Leif's Saga, and with runic emblems all
entwined in the vine that gave its name to the western world of the
Norseman as it now does to the Newport Vinland. Throughout the house
the spirit and influence of William Morris, as poet and designer, are
shown. Architect and artisan have worked in admirable and affective
sympathy. The drawing room is full of light and the carving in wood
of the vine on the mantel and around and over the fireplace is
carried on in a graceful stucco frieze, relieved by a tinge of color,
with mottoes and arms and emblems running freely around. The walls
are hung with a cool stuff, the design repeating in varying colors
and different material for the furniture cover and the carpet, and
the portieres are made on Morris's own looms and often his own
handiwork. The fire dogs are repetitions of those of Haddon Hall, and
with the chandelier are the work of handicraftsmen who have studied
under Morris and are now his colaborers. The rich yellow giallo
antico of the marble mantel gives a tone to the decoration all about
it.</P>

<CENTER><B>SOME PARTICULARS OF BEAUTY</B></CENTER>

<P>In the library there are rich carvings on the pillars that support
the arch of the great bow, done by Edson of Boston, which show great
force and strength. The ceiling, too, shows the skill of the native
workman in carrying out the architect's design, while between the
panels are painted in subdued tones the arms and monograms of all the
early printers - Fust, Scheffer, Guttenberg, Caxton, and Wynkyn de
Worde, the various Wolfes, and other notable early masters of the
art. The walls of the hall and stairway are hung with old Flemish
tapestry, and the reflection of an old mirror, a family relic going
back to the times of good colonial work, makes the woven pictures
fresh and bright again. In front of the great window is suspended by
chains from the ceiling a great Northern vase, in beaten copper and
iron, alternating black and gold, from which at night the light will
pour out over the stairs, while the drawing-room will be lit by a
chandelier of metals of five kinds and colors. The morning-room is in
black wood, relieved by gold, with a ceiling, painted by Treadwell,
of Boston, in morning glories and homely flowers; and one window-door
opens on the broad terrace, with its dark-red sandstone walls and its
bed of green, bright with ribbon gardening, and a flight of steps
leading down to the lawn, where Bowditch has subdued trees and plants
and flowers to be a foreground for the sloping cliff and the
boundless sea view, with the rocks jutting above the green water.</P>

<P>The parquetry of the floors is half hidden by rugs of Persian and
Turkish pattern, and by those of Morris's design, whose hand is also
shown in the bed-rooms and living rooms of the upper story, where the
architect has shown his appreciation of domestic comfort and has met
the requirements of every-day life. Much old family furniture finds
its place throughout the house. The long, low rooms open into one
another with generous doors, and the contrast of color and decoration
heightens the effect of the architectural lines without in the least
diminishing the comfortable and home-like air of the whole house. The
outlook on the sea over the sloping green lawn makes a picture from
every casement. On the other side the Messrs. Bowditch have carefully
preserved the picturesque old trees of the Lawrence homestead, and
have found room for some that were brought from the old Wolfe place
in Westchester County, N.Y., and all are growing well in the rich
soil on which the broad curves of leaf plants rest. The pictures,
oils and water-colors, and drawings throughout the house are
provisionally hung, but all are examples of the best art, and in
pleasant conformity to the exquisite taste and simple love of the
beautiful that have subdued all in and out of the house, in spite of
its newness, into a succession of pictures. It is a house to be lived
in, and yet it is, in stone, and wood, and metal, and glass, and
fresco, and furnishing and decoration, just what its name suggests,
Vinland, a Northern home, full of the inspiration of Norse story and
of Longfellow's verses, giving Newport another example of what good
art can do in the service of a good master.</P>

<P>The result is something upon which the eye can rest in comfort;
for there is no view, out of doors or in, that does not please by the
grace and beauty on all sides. Even the stables and outbuildings have
a dignity of their own, without pretending to be more or other than
they are. The good old public right of way has been carefully
acknowledged and protected, and a comfortable foot path keeps the
walk on the cliffs open in full view of the house and the grounds,
while the terrace and the broad porches secure the house and its
occupants from curious eyes. The rapidity with which the work has
been done is not less surprising than its solidity and the
substantial excellence and thoroughness of everything above ground
and in view, many well guarantee the hidden things, the underground
drains and sewers, and all the important elements of health in the
house. To it the Newport people now look with pride and satisfaction,
for is it is the last so it is the best addition to the homes that
increase the affection which old Newporters have for their little
island, with its mild climate, rocky cliffs, greensward, and
picturesque scenery.</P>
