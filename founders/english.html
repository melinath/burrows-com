   subsequently. Since then this portion has been reprinted, more or
   less accurately, from time to time, In unauthorised editions..
   
   <P>There are in existence no less than four copies of the lecture,

<FONT SIZE="+3">A</FONT>MONG the many debts which we owe to the
supreme aesthetic faculty of Goethe is that he was the first to teach
us to define beauty in terms the most concrete possible, to realise
it, I mean, always in its .special manifestations. So, in the lecture
which I have the honour to deliver before you, I will not try to give
you any abstract definition of beauty--any such universal formula for
it as was sought for by the philosophy of the eighteenth
century--still less to communicate to you that which in its essence
is incommunicable, the virtue by which a particular picture or poem
effects us with a unique and special joy; but rather to point out to
you the general idea which characterise the great English Renaissance
of Art in this century, to discover their source, as far as that is
possible, and to estimate their future as far as that is
possible.</P>

<P>I call it our English Renaissance because it is indeed a sort of
new birth of the spirit of man, like the great Italian Renaissance of
the fifteenth century, in its desire for a more gracious and comely
way of life, its passion for physical beauty, its exclusive attention
to form, its seeking for new subjects for poetry, new forms of art,
new intellectual and imaginative enjoyments: and I call it our
romantic movement because it is our most recent expression of
beauty.</P>

<P>It has been described as a mere revival of Greek modes of thought,
and again as a mere revival of mediaeval feeling. Rather I would say
that to these forms of the human spirit it has added whatever of
artistic value the intricacy and complexity and experience of modern
life can give: taking from the one its clearness of vision and its
sustained calm, from the other its variety of expression and the
mystery of its vision. For what, as Goethe said, is the study of the
ancients but a return to the real world (for that is what they did);
and what, said Mazzini, is mediaevalism but individuality?</P>

<P>It is really from the union of Hellenism, in its breadth, its
sanity of purpose, its calm possession of beauty, with the adventive,
the intensified individualism, the passionate colour of the romantic
spirit, that springs the art of the nineteenth century in England, as
from the marriage of Faust and Helen of Troy sprang the beautiful boy
Euphorion.</P>

<P>Such expressions as 'classical' and 'romantic' are, it is true,
often apt to become the mere catch. words of schools. .We must always
remember that art has only one sentence to utter: there is fur her
only one high law, the law of form or harmony--yet between the
classical and romantic spirit we may say that there lies this
difference at least that the one deals with the type and the other
with the exception. In the work produced under the modern romantic
spirit it is no longer the permanent, the essential truths of life
that are treated of; it is the momentary situation of the one, the
momentary aspect of the other that art seeks to render. In sculpture,
which is the type of one spirit, the subject predominates over the
situation; in painting, which is the type of the other, the situation
predominates over the subject.</P>

<P>There are two spirits, then: the Hellenic spirit and the spirit of
romance may be taken as forming the essential elements of our
conscious intellectual tradition, of our permanent standard of taste.
As regards their origin, in art as in politics there is but one
origin for all revolutions, a desire on the part of man for a nobler
form of life, for a freer method and opportunity of expression. Yet,
I think that in estimating the sensuous and intellectual spirit which
presides over our English Renaissance, any attempt to isolate it in
any way from the progress and movement and social life of the age
that has produced it would be to rob it of its true vitality,
possibly to mistake its true meaning. And in disengaging from the
put-quits and passions of this crowded modern world those passions
and pursuits which have to do with art and the love of art, we must
take into account many great events of history which seem to be the
most opposed to any such artistic feeling.</P>

<P>Alien then from any wild, political passion, or from the harsh
voice of a rude people in revolt, as our English Renaissance must
seem, in its passionate cult of pure beauty, its flawless devotion to
form, its exclusive and sensitive nature, it is to the French
Revolution that we must look for the most primary factor of its
production, the first condition of its birth: that great Revolution
of which we are all the children though the voices of some of us be
often loud against it; that Revolution to which at a time when even
such spirits as Coleridge and Wordsworth lost heart in England, noble
messages of love blown across seas came from your young Republic.</P>

<P>It is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history has
shown us that neither in politics nor in nature are there revolution
ever but evolutions only, and that the prelude to that wild storm
which swept over France in 1789 and made every king in Europe tremble
for his throne, was first sounded in literature years before the
Bastille fell and the Palace was taken. The way for those red scenes
by Seine and Loire was paved by that critical spirit of Germany and
England which accustomed men to bring all things to the test of
reason or utility or both, while the discontent of the people in the
streets of Paris was the echo that followed the life of Emile and of
Werther. For Rousseau, by silent lake and mountain, had called
humanity back to the golden age that still lies before us and
preached a return to nature, in passionate eloquence whose music
still lingers about our keen northern air. And Goethe and Scott had
brought romance back again from the prison she had lain in for so
many centuries--and what is romance but humanity?</P>

<P>Yet in the womb of the Revolution itself, and in the storm and
terror of that wild time, tendencies were hidden away that the
artistic Renaissance bent to her own service when the time came--a
scientific tendency first, which has borne in our own day a brood of
somewhat noisy Titans, yet in the sphere of poetry has not been
unproductive of good. I do not mean merely in its adding to
enthusiasm that intellectual basis which is its strength, or that
more obvious influence about which Wordsworth was thinking when he
said very nobly that poetry was merely the impassioned expression in
the face of science, and that when science would put on a form of
flesh and blood the poet would lend his divine spirit to aid the
transfiguration. Nor do I dwell much on the great cosmical emotion
and deep pantheism of science to which Shelley has given its first
and Swinburne its latest glory of song, but rather on its influence
on the artistic spirit in preserving that close observation and the
sense of limitation as well as of clearness of vision which are the
characteristics of the real artist.</P>

<P>The great and golden rule of art as well as of life, wrote William
Blake, is that the more distinct, sharp and defined the boundary
line, the more perfect is the work of art; and the less keen and
sharp the greater is the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism and
bungling. 'Great inventors in all ages knew this--Michael Angelo and
Albert Durer are known by this and by this alone'; and another time
he wrote, with all the simple directness of nineteenth-century prose,
'to generalise is to be an idiot.'
