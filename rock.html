<P>Rockland, Massachusetts, is a small town of about 15,000 located
20 miles southeast of Boston. Midway between Boston and Plymouth, and
10 miles inland from the Atlantic coast, Rockland adjoins the
historic towns of Weymouth, Hingham, Abington and Hanover. The area
was settled as a farming community in the early 18th century, and was
incorporated as the town of Abington in 1712. Union Street, now the
town center, was developed in East Abington in 1812, and by the time
of the Civil War East Abington was a thriving commercial center, with
shoemaking as the major industry. Significant inventions in Abington
in the early 19th century transformed the shoemaking industry from a
hand operation to a machine powered industry and brought prosperity
to the community. In 1874, fueled by anger over taxes raised for a
school in Abington Center, East Abington seceded and took the name of
Rockland for the new town. In the twentieth century the Boston
suburbs have grown around Rockland, and it is home now to banking
offices and light industry.</P>
