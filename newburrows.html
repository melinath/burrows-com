         <P>Burrows &amp; Company has supplied all the carpet and
         window curtains for the new Nauvoo Temple for the LDS Church
         (Mormons) in Nauvoo, Illinois. This extraordinary project
         was to reconstruct the original temple that was built from
         1841-46 and destroyed in 1848 after the Mormon exodus to
         Utah. The English carpeting is in designs that have been
         drawn from patterns of the early-mid 19th century, and
         Madras lace curtains were custom woven in Scotland
         incorporating symbolic elements from the architecture of the
         building. The Nauvoo Temple will be dedicated in June, 2002.
