<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>DANCING.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Lord Chesterfield, in his letters to his son, says: "Dancing is,
in itself, a very trifling and silly thing: but it is one of those
established follies to which people of sense are sometimes obliged to
conform; and then they should be able to do it well. And though I
would not have you a dancer, yet, when you do dance, I would have you
dance well, as I would have you do everything you do well." In
another letter, he writes: "Do you mind your dancing while your
dancing master is with you? As you will be often under the necessity
of dancing a minuet, I would have you dance it very well. Remember
that the graceful motion of the arms, the giving of your hand, and
the putting off and putting on of your hat genteelly, are the
material parts of a gentleman's dancing. But the greatest advantage
of dancing well is, that it necessarily teaches you to present
yourself, to sit, stand, and walk genteelly; all of which are of real
importance to a man of fashion."</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>GIVING A BALL.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>If you cannot afford to give a ball in good style, you had better
not attempt it at all.</P>

<P>Having made up your mind to give a ball and to do justice to the
occasion, and having settled upon the time, the next thing is to
decide whom and how many to invite. In deciding upon the number a due
regard must be paid to the size of the rooms; and after allowance for
a reasonable number who may not accept the invitation, there should
be no more invited than can find comfortable accommodations, both
sitting and standing-room being taken into account, and at the same
time have the floor properly free for dancing. The more guests you
have the more brilliant, and the fewer you have the more enjoyable,
will the occasion be.</P>

<P>Any number over a hundred guests constitutes a "large ball;" under
fifty it is merely a "dance."</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/mrsa.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=216 ALIGN=right></P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>CHOICE OF GUESTS.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>As dancing is <I>the</I> amusement of the evening, due regard
should be paid to the dancing qualifications of the proposed
guests.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>ISSUING INVITATIONS.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>The invitations issued and accepted for an evening party will be
written in the same style as those already described for a
dinner-party. They should be sent out <I>at least</I> from seven to
ten days before the day fixed for the event, and should be replied to
within a week of their receipt, accepting or declining with regrets.
By attending to these courtesies, the guests will have time to
consider their engagements and prepare their dresses, and the hostess
will also know what will be the number of her party.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>PREJUDICES AGAINST
DANCING</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>One should be scrupulous and not wound the prejudices of a friend
by sending her an invitation to a ball when it is well known she is
conscientiously opposed to dancing.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>NOTES OF
INTERROGATION.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>No one now sends a <I>note</I> of interrogation to a dance; cards
are universally employed. The form of an invitation to a tea-party
differs from that to a dance, in respect that the one specifies that
you are invited <I>to tea</I>, the other does not, but merely
requests the pleasure of your company <I>on such an evening</I>, and
perhaps names the hour.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>VARIETY OF TOILET.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Vary your toilet as much as possible, for fear that idlers and
malignant wits, who are always a majority in the world, should amuse
themselves by making your dress the description of your person.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>CHOICE OF ATTIRE.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Certain fashionables seek to gain a kind of reputation by the odd
choice of their attire, and by their eagerness to seize upon the
first caprices of the fashions. Propriety with difficulty tolerates
these fancies of a spoiled child; but it applauds a woman of sense
and taste, who is not in a hurry to follow the fashions, and asks how
long they will last, before adopting them; finally, who selects and
modifies them with success according to her size and figure.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>EVENING PARTY.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>If it is to be a simple evening party, in which we may wear a
summer walking-dress, the mistress of the house gives verbal
invitations, and does not omit to <B>apprise</B> her friends of this
circumstance, or they might appear in unsuitable dresses. If, on the
contrary the soiree is to be in reality a ball, the invitations are
written, or what is better, printed and expressed in the third
person.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>&nbsp;</B></FONT></P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>THE CLOAK ROOM.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>A room appropriate for the purpose, and furnished with cloak-pins
to hang up the shawls and other dresses of the ladies, is almost
indispensable. Domestics should be there also, to aid them in taking
off and putting on their outside garments.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>WHEN TO ARRIVE.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>We are not obliged to go exactly at the appointed hour; it is even
fashionable to go an hour later. Married ladies are accompanied by
their husbands; unmarried ones, by their mother, or by an escort.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>REFUSING TO DANCE.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>A lady cannot refuse the invitation of a gentleman to dance,
unless she has already accepted that of another, for she would be
guilty of an incivility which might occasion trouble; she would,
moreover, seem to show contempt for him whom she refused, and would
expose herself to receive in secret an ill compliment from the
mistress of the house.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>GIVING A REASON FOR NOT
DANCING.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>When a young lady declines dancing with a gentleman, it is her
duty to give him a reason why, although some thoughtless ones do not.
No matter how frivolous it may be, it is simply an act of courtesy to
offer him an excuse; while, on the other hand, no gentleman ought so
far to compromise his self-respect as to take the slightest offense
at seeing a lady by whom he has just been refused, dance immediately
after with some one else.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>HOW TO ASK A LADY TO
DANCE.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In inviting a lady to dance with you, the words, "Will you
<I>honor</I> me with your hand for a quadrille?" or, "Shall I have
the <I>honor</I> of dancing this set with you?" are more used now
than "Shall I have the <I>pleasure</I>?" or, "Will you give me the
<I>pleasure</I> of dancing with you."</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>LEAVING A BALL ROOM.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Married or young ladies, cannot leave a ball-room or any other
party, alone. The former should be accompanied by one or two other
married ladies, and the latter by their mother, or by a lady to
represent her.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>TALKING TOO MUCH.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Ladies should avoid talking too much; it will occasion remarks. It
has also a bad appearance to whisper continually in the ear of your
partner.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>WALL FLOWERS.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>The master of the house should see that all the ladies dance; he
should take notice, particularly of those who seem to serve as
<I>drapery</I> to the walls of the ball-room, (or
<I>wall-flowers</I>, as the familiar expression is,) and should see
that they are invited to dance. But he must do this wholly
unperceived, in order not to wound the self-esteem of the unfortunate
ladies.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>DUTIES OF GENTLEMEN.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Gentlemen whom the master of the house requests to dance with
these ladies, should be ready to accede to his wish, and even appear
pleased at dancing with a person thus recommended to their
notice.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>DUTIES OF LADIES.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Ladies who dance much, should be very careful not to boast before
those who dance but little or not at all, of the great number of
dances for which they are engaged in advance. They should also,
without being perceived, recommend to these less fortunate ladies,
gentlemen of their acquaintance.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>WHILE DANCING.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In giving the hand for ladies chain or any other figures, those
dancing should wear a smile, and accompany it with a polite
inclination of the head, in the manner of a salutation. At the end of
the dance, the gentleman reconducts the lady to her place, bows and
thanks her for the honor which she has conferred. She also bows in
silence, smiling with a gracious air.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>RESERVE AND
POLITENESS.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In these assemblies, we should conduct ourselves with reserve and
politeness towards all present, although they may be unknown to
us.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>WHEN NOT TO DANCE.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Never hazard taking part in a quadrille, unless you know how to
dance tolerably; for if you are a novice, or but a little skilled,
you would bring disorder into the midst of pleasure. Being once
engaged to take part in a dance, if the figures are not familiar, be
careful not to advance first. You can in this way govern your steps
by those who go before you. Beware, also, of taking you place in a
set of dancers more skillful than yourself. When an unpracticed
dancer makes a mistake, we may apprize him of his error; but it would
be very impolite to have the air of giving him a lesson.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>GRACE AND MODESTY.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Dance with grace and modesty, neither affect to make a parade of
your knowledge; refrain from great leaps and ridiculous jumps, which
would attract the attention of all towards you.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>PRIVATE PARTY.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In a private ball or party, it is proper for a lady to show still
more reserve, and not manifest more preference for one gentleman than
another; she should dance with all who ask properly.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>PUBLIC BALLS.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In public balls, a gentleman offers his partner refreshments, but
which she very seldom accepts, unless she is well acquainted with
him. But in private parties, the persons who receive the company,
send round cake and other refreshments, of which every one helps
themselves. Near the end of the evening, in a well regulated ball, it
is customary to have a supper; but in a soiree, without great
preparation, we may dispense with a supper; refreshments are,
however, necessary, and not to have them would be the greatest
impoliteness.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>VISIT OF THANKS.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>We should retire <I>incognito</I>, in order not to disturb the
master and mistress of the house; and we should make them, during the
week, a visit of thanks, at which we may converse of the pleasure of
the ball and the good selection of the company.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>DEPORTMENT IN PUBLIC
PEACES.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>The proprieties in deportment, which concerts require, are little
different from those which are recognized in every other assembly, or
in public exhibitions, for concerts partake of the one and the other,
according as they are public or private. In private concerts, the
ladies occupy the front seats, and the gentlemen are generally in
groups behind, or at the side of them. We should observe the most
profound silence, and refrain from beating time, humming the airs,
applauding, or making ridiculous gestures of admiration. It often
happens that a dancing soiree succeeds a concert, and billets of
invitation, distributed two or three days before hand should give
notice of it to the persons invited.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>GENERAL RULES FOR A
BALL-ROOM.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>A lady will not cross a ball-room unattended.</P>

<P>A gentleman will not take a vacant seat next to a lady who is a
stranger to him. If she is an acquaintance, he may do so with her
permission.</P>

<P>White kid gloves should be worn at a ball, and only be taken off
at supper-time.</P>

<P>In dancing quadrilles do not make any attempt to take steps. A
quiet walk is all that is required.</P>

<P>When a gentleman escorts a lady home from a ball, she should not
invite him to enter the house; and even if she does so, he should by
all means decline the invitation. he should call upon her during the
next day or evening.</P>

<P>As the guests enter the room, it is not necessary for the lady of
the house to advance each time toward the door, but merely to rise
from her seat to receive their courtesies and congratulations. If,
indeed, the hostess wishes to show particular favor to some
peculiarly honored guests, she may introduce them to others, whose
acquaintance she may imagine will be especially suitable and
agreeable.</P>

<P>When entering a private ball or party, the visitor should
invariably bow to the company. No well-bred person would omit this
courtesy in entering a drawing-room; although the entrance to a large
assembly may be unnoticed.</P>

<P>Any presentation to a lady in a public ball-room, for the mere
purpose of dancing, does not entitle you to claim her acquaintance
afterwards; therefore, should you meet her, at most you may lift your
hat; but even that is better avoided - unless, indeed, she first bow
- as neither she nor her friends can know who or what you are.</P>

<P>Never wait until the signal is given to take a partner, for
nothing is more impolite than to invite a lady hastily, and when the
dancers are already in their places; it can be allowed only when the
set is incomplete.</P>

<P>In private parties, a lady is not to refuse the invitation of a
gentleman to dance, unless she is previously engaged. the hostess
must be supposed to have asked to her house only those persons whom
she knows to be perfectly respectable and of unblemished character,
as well as pretty equal in position; and thus, to decline the offer
of any gentleman present, would be a tacit reflection on the
gentleman or lady of the house.</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>CONCLUSION.</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>There is a custom which is sometimes practiced both in the
assembly room and at private parties, which cannot be too strongly
reprehended; we allude to the habit of ridicule and ungenerous
criticism of those who are ungraceful or otherwise obnoxious to
censure, which is indulged in by the thoughtless, particularly among
the dancers. Of its gross impropriety and vulgarity we need hardly
express an opinion; but there is such an utter disregard for the
feelings of others implied in this kind of negative censorship, that
we cannot forbear to warn our young readers to avoid it. The "Koran"
says: "Do not mock - the mocked may be better than the mocker." Those
you condemn may not have had the same advantages as yourself in
acquiring grace or dignity, while they may be infinitely superior in
purity of heart and mental accomplishments. The advice of
Chesterfield to his son, in his commerce with society, to <I>do as
you would be done by</I>, is founded on the Christian precept, and
worth of commendation. Imagine yourself the victim of another's
ridicule, and you will cease to indulge in a pastime which only gains
for you the hatred of those you satirize, if they chance to observe
you, and the contempt of others who have noticed your violation of
politeness, and abuse of true society.</P>
