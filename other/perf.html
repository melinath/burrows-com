<P>It may be that some will think a perfume of some sort is essential
to complete the toilet.  "The most refined people, however, avoid
personal perfumes, and hold that the absence of all odor is the best
savor of human communication.  Those of nice taste eschew all
perfumes but those that are evanescent, such as cologne and the
like."  A strong perfume of any kind is not desirable, if, indeed, it
be not actually vulgar.  There is always a suggestion that it
conceals some foulness.</P>
