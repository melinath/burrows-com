				<p><b>The Stag</b>, by C.F.A. Voysey, Architect and Designer</p>
				<p>An exclusive design from Rose's Mill in Scotland, made as a fine 10-point lace. Burrows &amp; Co. also offers The Stag as a hand-printed wallpaper, and as a border.</p>
				<p>C.F.A. Voysey was a prominent Arts &amp; Crafts Movement architect and designer from England. His lace panel of The Stag was originally produced in Scotland in the early 1900s.</p>
				<p>Many English Arts &amp; Crafts textiles are of a grand scale, even though they are often used in houses of modest scale. This large panel is beautiful on windows as narrow as 35 - 40&quot; wide by using one panel per window. John Burrows has The Stag as drapes in his sitting room windows - pulled back to one side and gathered a foot above the window sill with a curtain tie-back - they are draped low to hang very full so that the design can be seen to best advantage. Because of the overall figuring in the pattern, they are an excellent design for the windows of houses in the city and suburbs that do not have a worthwhile view (shades under the lace are still recommended when privacy is required at night).</p>
				<p>As well as a stunning curtain panel, this design can be used as bed hangings for four-poster beds. We also suggest The Stag as a bed covering over a dark coverlet or sheet (95&quot; fits a full size mattress, and 118&quot; long fits a queen-size mattress).</p>
				<p>Fabric content: 95% cotton, 5% polyester<br>
					Color: Natural White or Ecru<br>
				</p>
				<p><strong>The Stag Panels:<br>
			</strong>72&quot; Wide x 72&quot; Long = $142
		 	     <br>72&quot; Wide x 95&quot; Long = $171<br>
				  	 72&quot; Wide x 118&quot; Long = $200<br>
				</p>
				<p><strong>The Stag Panels (Narrow):<br>
					</strong>
					    51&quot; Wide x 72&quot; Long = $117

					<br>51&quot; Wide x 118&quot; Long = $182</p>
					
				<p>All sizes are approximate, with a 3% allowable variance.</p>
