<P>I suppose it is easier to come back to the original wood-work in
some places than it is in others. But, in New York, it is almost out
of the question to hope for a return to the old style for a simple
reason - the reason that controls so many schemes for decoration and
improvement here - the narrowness of the lots. Slight as is the
projection of a wainscot, even so little diminution of the width of
one of our city rooms, tells, not only on its looks but on the actual
comfort of the occupant. And beside, it is not really needed in city
houses, at least, the need of it is not so pressing as to enable us
to forget the discomfort of a few inches less of space to move in.
Accordingly, we have agreed to compromise the matter by a simulated
wainscot formed of the customary baseboard of the room, and the
so-called chair-rail - a strip of wood either flat or else moulded,
but not projecting more than half an inch at the most from the wall -
and between these, wall-paper laid as usual upon the plaster.</P>

<P>I confess I do not like the modern way, the fashionable way, of
treating this lower division of the wall. The cases must be few in
which it will be advisable to treat it in any but the simplest
manner. Remember, the prime use of the wainscot or dado was to
protect the walls, or if not that, then to protect the persons who
used the rooms from the damp and chilly stone or brick. When plaster
came to be employed, the wainscot kept the lower part of the wall
from getting knocked or defaced, and after all, that is the main
reason for keeping up the semblance of the old device. To be sure,
the Pompeians, from whom we get our way of treating the wall; painted
the lower part with a design of its own, water-weeds and flowering
plants, with aquatic birds, or, still-life pictures, a group of fish,
lobsters, and other things of the sort, with a mischievous cat
running away with a duck from the shelves of the pantry. But we
differ from the Pompeians in this, that our rooms are generally so
crowded with furniture, which, owing to the small dimension of the
rooms, we are obliged for the most part to put against the wall -
that we can not see whatever decoration may be upon the lower
portion. Let the reader, as he reads this book, look about the room
in which he is sitting and prove for himself, how small a portion of
the base of the wall three feet up from the floor, he can see for
more than a foot or two laterally. It is hid by the sofas and
etageres, the piano, and the smaller tables. The Pompeians, on the
other hand, had the least possible furniture, they lived much in the
open air, and we may be sure, if they decorated their walls down to
the floor, it was for the pleasure of seeing what was there, and not
for the mere pride of knowing that it was there and paid for, even if
it were covered up by furniture and never seen from one year's end to
another's.</P>

<P>No, what is suitable to the lower part of a wall, if it is to be
papered, is a rich, dark leather-paper in bronze, green, or
leather-brown, or deep red, with a pattern in renaissance scrolls,
arabesques, acanthus leaf, without gilding, or only heightened with
gold. Of course, this applies only to such rooms as the drawing-room,
the dining-room, or the living-room; and even then only when there is
a certain elegance or richness in the furniture. In a room plainly
furnished, or in the bedrooms, "plain handsomeness doth bear the
bell." The color of the paper chosen should of course be in harmony
with the general tone of the room. Such a dado as this will make a
good background for the furniture, and will not usurp to itself any
of the attention that ought to be given to more important portions of
the decoration. At the same time, if the room to be papered is a
summer one and lightly furnished, set out for instance with Chinese
sofas of bamboo, light chairs of cane or Vienna bent wood, then it
will be well enough to revert to the Pompeian plan and arrow-heads
with ducks and turtles; only, these things ought to be more freely
and artistically treated than is the wont with us.</P>

<P>And here I may ask - are we not too much wedded in these days to
the notion that, in ornamentation, the natural forms and look of
things should be altogether avoided? Of course, it is better, as a
rule, to have the edge of imitation taken off, but if our taste enjoy
this imitation, enough may be left to satisfy the picture-loving
instinct all human beings have in a greater or less degree. There was
a kind of tapestry made in Europe in the fifteenth century, in
Flanders probably, in which there were represented gentlemen and
ladies, the chatelaine and her suite, walking in the park of the
chateau. The figures, the size of life, seem to be following the
course of a slender stream which like Tennyson's "Brook" might
sing.</P>

   By many a field and fallow,<BR>
   And many a fairy foreland set,<BR>
   With willow-weed and mallow."</P></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The park in which these noble folk are stiffly disporting is
represented by a wide expanse of meadow guiltless of perspective,
stretching up to the top of the piece of stuff itself, a meadow
composed of leaves and flowers - blue-bells, daisies, and flowers
without a name, giving the effect of a close mosaic of green, mottled
with colored spots. On this meadow are scattered various figures of
animals and birds - the lion, the unicorn, the stag and the rabbit.
Here, too, are hawks and parrots, and in the upper part is a heron
which has been brought down by a hawk and is struggling with the
victor, some highly ornamental drops of blood on the heron's breast
showing that he is done for. And, to return to the brook which winds
along the bottom of the tapestry, it is curious to note that this
part of the work is more real and directly natural in its treatment
than the rest. The water is blue, and is varied by shading and by
lines that show the movement of the stream; the plants and bushes
growing along its borders are drawn with at least a conventional look
of life, some violets and fleurs de lys being particularly well done;
and in the stream itself are sailing several ducks, some pushing
straight ahead, others nibbling the grass along the bank, and one, at
least, diving to the bottom with tail and feet in the air.</P>

<P>Now if this realism and anecdote was good art in the fifteenth
century, and if it commends itself now to our unsophisticated
nineteenth century taste, why is it bad, why do the purists shrug
their shoulders when we talk of repeating in spirit the designs
approved by this old example? Partly this comes from a change of
taste and manners - 'twas a tapestry-fashion and it passed away with
tapestry itself; and partly 'tis the result of the mechanical
art-teaching that has prevailed for the last fifty years or less, and
that has had for its chief text the doctrine that we must avoid in
design all direct reference to natural forms, or, if we use them,
that we must conventionalize them out of all resemblance to their
originals.</P>

<P>Good art never did this at any time. Art has always, when at its
best, tried to give us as much nature as possible, and has only
conventionalized so far as was necessary for the material framework
that was to enclose the ornament. Botticelli, when he would decorate
the dress of his Flora in the "Allegory of Spring," sets it all over
with exquisitely-painted tufts of growing flowers which at a distance
indeed look like embroidery, and remind us of Chaucer's description
of the dress of the young squire:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER>"Short was his gowne with sleeves long and wide.
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P>* * * * * *</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P>Embroidered was he as it were a mede<BR>
   All full of freshe flowers white and rede."</P></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>And even Saracens whose art seems purely geometrical are as far as
possible from being scientifically or pedagogically formal and dry.
They turn geometry to grace and beauty, and in the myriad involutions
of their patterns appear to have discovered a new kingdom of nature
which, while we contemplate it, seems almost more beautiful than
flowers and gems. This is the very province of art, to make the whole
world minister to its love of beauty, and in right hands art can find
material for beauty in everything natural. Therefore we ought not to
lay down a law that this, that, or the other design in wall-paper, in
stuffs, in carpets, cannot be good, if it is what is called natural,
that is if it consists of flowers, fruits or leaves that distinctly
recall the objects of which it is composed. I think it capable of
very easy demonstration that a decoration may be perfectly suitable
and satisfactory in which the resemblance of the forms to nature is
very close, the conventionalizing being carried only a little
way.</P>

<P>So much for the wainscot. The middle portion of the wall being in
the direct line of vision is, of course, the most important of the
three. It is on this that our pictures, portraits, mirrors, sconces,
are hung, and the choice of a paper to cover this, space is generally
an extremely difficult matter for housekeepers. However, the decision
may be sooner arrived at, if we are quite settled in our minds as to
what use we intend making of this space. All depends upon whether we
have things, be they few or many, that must be seen, and seen to
advantage, or whether we have merely the ordinary, pretty or handsome
things that happen to be in fashion. In the former case, it is the
things that make the wall, and oblige us to subordinate all its
coloring and ornamentation to them. In the latter case, we can
presume that our pretty things, being themselves in the fashion, will
go well enough with any fashionable paper we take a fancy to. And it
may be that we shall wish to get off cheaply, and yet with good
effect, too, and to that end shall find a rich paper, either dark
with much gold, or gaily flowered, or with some entanglements of
lines or masses of brilliant color, and so fill up the space between
the dado and cornice with a background on which the varied objects
that make up the decoration of a modern drawing-room shall find a
place to their liking.</P>

<P>Also, we have to think of the situation of the room, and of the
time of day in which it is most used. For, if the room have much sun
in it during the day, we have to choose, either a coloring that will
temper the brightness of the sun's light, or, one that will so chime
with it as to be made more effective by it. The decision here depends
on whether the husband or the wife is the one more concerned in the
matter, for I believe it is commonly seen that men like a great deal
of sunlight in the house, and are pleased with a decoration of gold
or red, or colors in these keys, be they strong or pale, while ladies
for the more part like somber tints or such at least as absorb rather
than reflect the light. And, as the drawing-room is generally most
used by the ladies of the family in the day time, they will have the
natural right to be consulted as to the decoration.</P>

<P>If, however, the rooms to be papered are to be used much at night,
colors that light up well, as the phrase is, must be employed. Many a
room looks exceedingly pretty by day, or rich as a retreat from the
too much brightness of the sun, and yet by night, when perhaps it is
chiefly used, it cannot be made to look bright and gay, no matter how
many lamps or candles we light up. This is owing solely to the colors
employed on the walls, with which we always try to have the hangings
correspond, so that all works together to the uncomfortable result.
Lord Bacon, says, in his essay on "Masks and Triumphs" - "The colors
that show best by candle-light are white, carnation, and a kind of
sea-water green." he might have added others, and yellow among them,
that is, gold or golden yellow, though it is not easy to hit upon the
right shade. It should be of the most brilliant but soft
dandelion-color, and unless used in small quantities is almost too
brilliant for the day-time. But, at night, with flowers and with
candles, which happily are come into fashion again, a yellow
flock-paper in a large flowered or arabesque renaissance pattern has
a very rich and exhilarating effect in a drawing-room.</P>

<P>It should be remembered that much of the effectiveness of
wall-papers depends upon their being sparingly used. And, apart from
all questions of utility, this is one of the main arguments in
defense of the division of the wall which is now so much the fashion.
The old style was, to cover the walls with one vast expanse of paper,
from end to end, and from cornice to mop-board, and it would be hard
to say which had the more disheartening effect upon the visitor, the
sight of this desert when the paper was of a pale tint just off the
white, or when it was of a dark ground with a sprawling design, or
else with a very set pattern profusely relieved with gold. Nothing
was commoner twenty or thirty years ago than to see such a room, and
there are still plenty of them left, where these vast unadorned walls
were unrelieved by any ornament, except a family-portrait or two, and
the traditional vases on the mantle-shelf, always of Sevres or
make-believe Sevres porcelain, painted with extremely artificial
natural flowers, with an ormolu clock between them, and an ormolu
candle-branch at either end. In addition, the carpet swore at the
wall-paper, the stiffly-arranged curtains swore at the carpet, while
a burst of profane jeers came from the chorus of sofas and chairs
with their coverings in some irreconcilable color. But let not the
modern reader exult too soon. In these desperate parlors often enough
sat and talked people who were the delight of all who had the good
fortune to know them - sensible, witty, hospitable, gay, - in whose
society it would have been impossible for any but a coxcomb to have
given a thought to the artistic barrenness of the room. Nay, has not
the memory of these sterling souls almost made the rooms they lived
in, beautiful in spite of their ugliness?</P>

<P>So far as getting the worth of one's money is concerned, this old
way of papering rooms was far from being economical - that is, from
the aesthetic point-of-view. There is so much of it that we do not
see it; as the man said of the wood - "you could not see it, for the
trees." A little of the paper would have been more effective. When
the dado is dark, and the furniture covered with sober-hued stuffs -
though 'tis a mistake to have all the pieces or even the greater
number of them, covered with the same material - the central portion
only of the wall should have a wall-paper of pronounced richness,
and, as has been several times said, even this should be suited to
the use that is to be made of the space - whether it is to be seen
for itself, or made a background for the display of pictures and
ornaments.</P>

<P>The frieze is by many at the present day considered an essential
division of the wall, and should always be employed where the room is
of a good height. I like to divide the frieze from the central
portion by a picture-strip made strong enough to hold the smaller
frames - water-colors, etchings, plaques of porcelain, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., a stronger and more solid looking strip being placed
directly under the cornice for the suspension of the larger pictures.
If arranged with judgment the perpendicular lines of the cords
supporting these frames may be made effectively useful in correcting
the horizontal divisions of the wall itself. And the number of the
suspending cords may be diminished by employing for the smaller
pictures and indeed for all but the very large ones - portraits and
the like - a single cord instead of the usual to diverging ones.</P>
