<P>Received: March 2, 1999<BR>
Town Clerk's Office, Rockland MA</P>

<P>ROCKLAND ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS<BR>
ROCKLAND, MASSACHUSETTS 02370</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A public hearing was held on Wednesday, February 17, 1999 in the
auditorium of the Rockland High School at 8:30 P.M. on the petition
of Leo Noonan, Trustee of Susan Ellen Realty Trust for a special
permit for a "neighborhood convenience facility" and a variance from
the requirements of the Zoning By-law relative to signs to erect and
operate a Walgreens store at the corner of Union and Market Street in
Rockland in a R-3 residential zone.</P>

<P>Present and voting on the petition were members Joseph Bouchard,
Anton Materna, Peter McDermott, Rita Howes and Robert Manzella.</P>

<P>The applicant was represented by Attorney Robert Looney of
Rockland who presented facts and arguments as to why the petition
should be granted.</P>

<P>In addition to Attorney Looney, the applicant spoke in favor of
the petition as did Diane Gillis, owner of Tiffany's Rest Home,
situated on one of the parcels proposed as the site for
Walgreens.</P>

<P>If the petition were granted, the applicant would purchase three
parcels of land, and remove the existing historic houses and the rest
home therefrom. The applicant testified that he was under agreement
to move on of the houses to another location on Union Street rather
than demolish the structure. The other two structures would
nevertheless be demolished. Attorney Looney acknowledged that two of
the three lots are within Rockland&iacute;s Historic District.</P>

<P>Through testimony from the applicant and his attorney and
questioning from the Board and the Town Counsel, the following facts
were established:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The applicant has looked at other sites, but
   determined that the proposed site best fits Walgreen's needs.
   
   <P>2. The applicant will lease the site to Walgreens for a period
   of 20 years with a 40 year extension clause.</P>
   
   <P>3. The applicant declined to disclose the terms of the lease or
   the Purchase and Sales Agreement.</P>
   
   <P>4. The applicant was not clear or specific as to the number of
   deliveries per week, but stated an estimate of</P>
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE>*one large tractor trailer delivery per day and<BR>
      *unspecified numbers of other small truck deliveries daily.</BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P>5. Hours of operation would be from 8:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M.
   seven (7) days per week.</P>
   
   <P>6. There would be ten 24' high light poles on site as well as
   at least 2 illuminated red letter wall signs on each of the two
   street facing walls.</P>
   
   <P>7. The parking lot would accommodate a minimum of 56
   spaces.</P>
   
   <P>8. There would be a drive up window in the rear of the
   building.</P>
   
   <P>9. The applicant had no data on the number of anticipated
   vehicle trips per day. The applicant estimated that the store
   would service 3/4 customers per minute. At 14 hours per day this
   equates to an average of 630 customers per day.</P>
   
   <P>10. The applicant had not as yet obtained any permits for curb
   cuts.</P>
   
   <P>11. In addition to prescription medications, the applicant
   testified that the store would sell other items similar to what
   would be sold in a CVS.</P>
   
   <P>12. No representatives from Walgreens were present at the
   hearing to answer any questions.</P>
   
   <P>13. The applicant had no plans for traffic mitigation measures
   at Union or Market Street.</P>
   
   <P>14. The applicant had not engaged a traffic engineer prior to
   the hearing.</P>
   
   <P>15. The building would be 15,000 square feet of gross floor
   area.</P>
   
   <P>16. No architectural plans were submitted with the application.
   A photograph of a prototype Walgreens was given to the Board.</P>
   
   <P>17. If the permit were approved and the lots acquired, the site
   would contain 72,175 square feet of land.</P>
   
   <P>18. The store would employ 20 to 25 people.</P>
   
   <P>19. There would be a double wide delivery door on the back side
   of the building.</P>
   
   <P>20. The site plan indicated that the 10 foot buffer zone at all
   lot lines would not be maintained. There was no landscaping plan
   submitted to ensure compliance with the buffer zone
   requirements.</P>
   
   <P>21. There would be a 10' by 30' pad in the rear of the store
   holding 8' by 20' trash compactor.</P>
   
   <P>22. Delivery trucks would back up to the loading door.</P>
   
   <P>23. The applicant has not conducted a survey to determine the
   number and size of the trees that would be removed from the
   site.</P>
   
   <P>24. No drainage calculations have been performed.</P>
   
   <P>25. The applicant could not answer the questions as to the
   percentage of the lot that would be impervious.</P>
   
   <P>26. The applicant could not answer the questions as to the
   percentage of business from medications versus other retail
   items.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A substantial number of citizens, including abutters, the
Historical Commission, members of the Board of Selectmen, the
Planning Board, the Master Plan Committee, the North Rockland
Neighborhood Association and the Rockland 125th Anniversary Committee
spoke in opposition or voted their opposition to the permit.</P>

<P>The Board received a large volume of letters and a petition with
125 signatures in opposition to the permit.</P>

<P>The Board engaged in questions and answers and heard testimony for
approximately 2.5 hours. Among the several concerns that were
expressed were:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>a). Traffic problems on Union and Market Streets.
   
   <P>b). The capacity for Union and Market Street to handle
   additional traffic and the entrances and exits proposed to the
   site.</P>
   
   <P>c). Traffic safety.</P>
   
   <P>d). Pedestrian safety.</P>
   
   <P>e). Derogation of the Historic District and the residential
   neighborhood in general.</P>
   
   <P>f). The removal and/or demolition of three significant
   historical buildings.</P>
   
   <P>g). The removal or demolition of homes with significant beauty
   and unique architecture.</P>
   
   <P>h). Impact on property values of abutting homes.</P>
   
   <P>i). Noise from increased vehicular and foot traffic.</P>
   
   <P>j). Trash.</P>
   
   <P>k). Glare from the exterior lighting and from car head
   lights.</P>
   
   <P>l). Inadequacy of the presentation, lack of factual responses
   to relevant questions posed by the Board, and lack of any back up
   documentation or studies on traffic, vehicle trips, drainage, or
   landscaping.</P>
   
   <P>m).The architectural design of the proposed building including
   exterior illuminated wall signs are not in keeping with the
   character of the neighborhood.</P>
   
   <P>n). Proximity of the driveways and parking areas to abutting
   residences.</P>
   
   <P>o). Safety of access and egress.</P>
   
   <P>p). Air quality from car emissions.</P>
   
   <P>q). Whether a large retail store that relies primarily on
   vehicular traffic can be characterized as a neighborhood
   convenience facility.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>At the close of the public input, the Board deliberated briefly
and reiterated the concerns expressed by all opponents that had
testified or commented and the facts established by the
applicant.</P>

<P>Anton Materna made a motion to deny on the grounds that the use
was not in harmony with the intent and purpose of the By-law; would
denigrate the historic district and residential neighborhood; would
produce noise and glare observable at the lot lines in amounts
clearly detrimental to the adjacent uses; and would create or
exacerbate serious traffic problems. Peter McDermott seconded the
motion. The vote was unanimous to deny the petition.</P>

<P>NOTE: (1) This decision may be appealed to the District Court,
Land Court or Superior Court pursuant to Chapter 40A, Section 17.
Said appeal must be filed within 20 days after this decision is filed
with the Town Clerk. (2) Chapter 40A, Section II, states that in
part, that no variance or special permit shall take effect until the
Town Clerk certifies that 20 days have elapsed, and no appeal has
been filed. (3) This Board certifies that copies of this decision
have been filed with the Planning Board as well as with the Town
Clerk.</P>
