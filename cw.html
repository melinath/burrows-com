					<P><strong>Japanese Carp Lace<br>
						</strong></P>
					<p>Burrows &amp; Company offers a new lace design inspired by the famous Japanese Carp pattern by Candace Wheeler. This is woven as a fine 14 point lace with an especially high degree of delicacy. Wheeler, one of America's most important designer of the 19th and early 20th century, was inspired by Japanese stenciled fabrics. <!--The original printed textile that served as the document source for Burrows &amp; Company comes from the collection of the Mark Twain Memorial in Hartford, Connecticut.</p> -->

         <P><B>Burrows Studio: Carp Stencil<BR>
         by Candace Wheeler </B><A NAME=carpst></A></P>
         
         <P>This lively pattern was originally published by Candace
         Wheeler in the early 1900's as a design for a bathroom
         stencil. It is a two piece stencil, which allows for mixing
         shades and colors in the paints. The print shown here has
         two greens in the surround and the shell, and two blues used
         on the fish itself, with an effort made to maintain variety
         of tones from one application to the next. This stencil has
         also been effectively painted using just one color with
         different shading to highlight the figures. To achieve an
         artistic result, we suggest experimenting first with colors
         on posterboard before starting to work on the walls.</P>

<H4><CENTER>About Candace Wheeler (1827-1923)</CENTER></H4>

<P><B>Candace Wheeler</B> founded the Society of Decorative Art in
New York City in 1877 and was also a founder of the Women's Exchange,
a self-help organization established to aid women in 1877. In 1879
Mrs. Wheeler joined in partnership with noted artists Louis C.
Tiffany, Samuel Colman and Lockwood de Forest in the firm called
"Associated Artists," which produced interior decorations, pattern
designs and needle work for clients that included Samuel Clemens
(Mark Twain) in Hartford, Connecticut, and the White House. When this
partnership ended in 1883, Mrs. Wheeler continued "Associated
Artists" as an all-women design firm in New York, producing
needlework and printed textiles until 1907. In 1893 Mrs. Wheeler and
"Associated Artists" supervised the decoration of the Woman's
Building at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Candace Wheeler's
printed textile designs have a strong, self-assured line quality and
show a marked influence of Japanese art which was in fashion in the
late 19th century.</P>
