<B>EDITOR'S NOTE TO THE WORLD WIDE WEB EDITION.</B></P></CENTER>

<P>This important pamphlet helped to shape trendsetting taste in
America in the 1880's. Although it is often quoted, copies are rare
and the text has not been widely accessible to students of 19th
century interior design. This web page edition is offered in the hope
that Cook's ideas will gain greater circulation, as the ideas are as
valid today as they were to the original audience.</P>

<H3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</H3>

<P>The critics, as a whole, have been kind to this trifle, and even
when they have seemed less amiable than was to be desired, I have
tried to profit by their strictures. It seems ungrateful to our
friends to say it, yet it is nevertheless true, that we get but
little real good from praise, while we can often learn something from
the fault-finding of those who are plainly more bent on harming than
on helping us by their fault-finding. A common criticism is, that my
essay is "vague;" and so, no doubt, it may justly be charged with
being, if looked at from one side only. But, my aim in writing was
rather to offer suggestions, and to interest people in the subject,
than to give advice, or to lay down formal rules. I wished to propose
some general principles, and to leave the reader free to make such
particular application of them as his own taste or his own needs
might lead him to. The prettiest rooms I see are those where the
owners, people of education and of good natural taste, have arranged
things - often with professional aid, it is true - to suit themselves
and their own way of living. And the most unhappy rooms I know are
some in which professional decorators and architects have had their
own way, and have reduced everything to a perfectly "correct" and
"fashionable" vapidity -</P>

<CENTER>"Faulty faultless, icily regular, splendidly null."</CENTER>

<P>I have to thank one of my critics - a friendly one this time - for
setting me right as to the etymology of the word "dado" - <A HREF="what3.html#dado">see
below.</A> A writer in the Art-Amateur informs me that it is an
architectural term answering to the word "die" with which we are all
familiar when it is used in describing the parts of a pedestal. The
word "dado" in Spanish and Italian, means a cube, and like the
answering de of the French and "die," &#91;plural, "dice"&#93; of the
English, is commonly employed for the small ivory cubes used in
certain games of chance. It is easy to see how it applies to the main
part of a pedestal, which is generally a six-sided block resting on a
moulded base and crowned with a cornice. But, as applied to one of
the divisions of a flat wall, the use of the word becomes somewhat
figurative. The wall in this case represents one side only of the
die, the chair-rail answers to the cornice, and the skirting-board to
the base.</P>

<H3><CENTER>"WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH OUR WALLS?"</CENTER></H3>

<P>Most of us, whether we have plenty of money, or only a moderate
portion to lay out in making our rooms handsome with furniture and
ornaments, find ourselves nonplused when, in the process of fitting
up and furnishing our houses, we come to the question, "What shall we
do with our walls?"</P>

<P>The covering of the floors is easily settled, for, there, the
choice is between a hard floor with rugs, or a carpet covering the
whole planking, and allowing not a square inch of it to be seen. The
ceiling too, we are so in the habit of leaving untouched, in all the
empty whiteness of the original plaster, that it hardly enters as an
element into the problem. But the walls cannot be so easily disposed
of. We must be looking at them, whether we will or no, and their
common refusal to play a harmonious part in our scheme for making our
rooms agreeable to the eye frets us to find out a remedy.</P>

<P>I think there will be a better way found for treating the walls of
rooms than the old way - of which Pompeii shows us so many examples -
of coloring the plaster when it is fresh, with harmonious ground
tints, relieved with a painted decoration of lines, geometric or
flowing patterns, - garlands of flowers, dancing nymphs and
fluttering cupids, with, not seldom, complete pictures even - their
subjects drawn from the mythology of the people. This decoration was
extended in many cases to the ceilings, and even where they were not
covered with plaster, but the beams that supported the floor and the
room above were left in sight, these were also painted in a style
harmonious with the walls. The floors were laid in a mosaic formed by
small bits of marble arranged in patterns and pressed into a bed of
mortar, and in the houses of the rich these floors were spread with
rugs or skins.</P>

<P>But when we come to propose this simple and agreeable decoration
for our own houses, we are met with a formidable obstacle. Whom shall
we call upon to color our walls for us? Who did the work for the
people of Pompeii, and not only for them, but for the inhabitants of
every other third-rate town in Southern Italy? Who did this work, we
may as well ask, for the Italian people in general, since this
decoration was not confined to Southern Italy, but was the rule all
over the peninsula. There can be no other answer than that it was
done by the same class of workmen who do our better house-painting.
Artists, in our sense of the term, were certainly not employed in
producing this rude but effective decoration. Effective it certainly
is, if we look at it as it still remains on many walls in the ruined
city, or even in the specimens preserved in the Museum at Naples.
But, if we see it divested of color, in the photographic
reproductions, where we are obliged to consider the drawing by
itself, we see only too painfully that very clumsy hands have been at
work. This, however, is not of great importance, since we do not
observe the drawing of these figures when we are enjoying the color.
It is noticed in a higher domain of art, that, as a rule, the
colorist and the draughtsman are seldom found in the same person, and
in this humble field of Pompeian wall decoration, the colorist
controls the work, and we neither miss, nor regret, the
draughtsman.</P>

<P>Yet the color, too, is conventional, and one house so like another
that, at last, after running the city over day after day, we detect
the Pompeian scheme, of which red, yellow, blue, green, and brown,
with red and white, are the constant elements, but combined in
infinite variety. The patterns, too, and even the subject of the
pictures, are repeated again and again.</P>

<P>At last we come to believe that the Pompeian house-painters had
each his pattern book, whether of colors or designs, as out own
workmen have, from which the client selected what pleased his eye, or
was suitable to his needs or his means. The poorer man must be
content with a plain wash for wall or ceiling, with a few lines
dividing the field into agreeable spaces, and perhaps a bird or a
small cupid, in the centre of each panel; but the man who could pay,
might have a frieze with acanthus and honeysuckle, a dado with
water-weeds and aquatic birds, and in the middle space some simulated
architecture with slender colonnettes, or a stately painting of the
Deserted Ariadne, or Paris and the Goddesses on Ida. Whatever was
wanted could be supplied, but it was tradesmen, not artists who
supplied it.</P>

<P>Here, then, is the practical difficulty that meets us when we
propose to adopt the simple, yet rich and effective, Pompeian
decoration in our own houses. Our workmen, no matter of what
nationality, have not the natural taste, nor the training, that fits
them to do the work of the Pompeian house-painter. There may be
practical reasons for this growing out of the difference between our
way of building and theirs; a difference which made it necessary for
them to paint their walls, while we need not do so unless we will.
Their houses were very rudely built; the walls laid up in a coarse
sort of rubble brought to a roughly even surface on the outside,
while the inside was faced with a smooth plaster, laid directly on
the wall, and not, as with us, on an inner lining of laths. The
consequence was that the inner surface partook of the irregularity of
the main wall, and was liable to be cracked or disturbed when that
was jarred. Coloring, and the rest of the decorative system, made
these imperfections less visible, and it would soon become a
universal practice to paint the walls as soon as the plaster was laid
on. It would thus follow, even supposing natural genius or aptitude
for the work to have been as wanting to these people as it is to us,
that such constant practice would have created it or developed it.
But I fancy there can be no doubt there was more native aptitude for
art among those descendants of the Greek Colonists than there is
among us. People who have learned the practice of Art, who have had
art forced into them in training-schools and schools-of-design, do
not so overflow with art productiveness as did these Southern
Italians, who lavished design upon everything that they made, from
pots and pans, weighing-scales and lamps, to their houses and
temples. Their art had all the abundance and familiarity of nature
herself. In Pompeii there is an absolute harmony between the work of
nature and the work of man. In Venus' temple we see the Summer
matching the intricate patterns of the ruined mosaic pavement with
her rosettes and stars of blood-red poppy and blue corn-flower, and
tracing the scrolls of her crumbling capitals with sprays of ivy,
like musing lines drawn by a regretful finger.</P>

<P>But, with us, all is, thus far, perfunctory and mechanical, and if
we trust to our workmen for artistic or agreeable results, we must
necessarily be disappointed. We have as good mechanics as are to be
found in the world, - carpenters, painters, masons, not to be beat.
They are ambitious too, and would stare to be told that grace and
elegance are not in their domain. Yet, leave to the best
house-painter in New York City the duty of painting the walls,
ceiling, woodwork of a room in one of our houses in rich harmonious
tones that shall satisfy the artistic or the cultivated eye, and, ten
to one, if his life depended on it, he could not do it.</P>
