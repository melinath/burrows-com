<P>Walgreens withdraws Rockland project following TODAY Show
appearance!</P>

<P>On June 17, 1999, Rockland's Walgreens battle was featured on the
TODAY Show. Within hours after Katie Couric summed up the drugstore
development issue with guest Richard Moe, President of the National
Trust for Historic Preservation, by saying "so, in your view they are
'paving paradise to put up a parking lot,'" word came that Walgreens
corporate executives had withdrawn the proposed development that
threatened the Rockland Historic District. For the full report of the

<P><B>NEWS:</B> A proposed Walgreens drugstore site tops the 1999
list of the most endangered historic places in America, according to
the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Drawing attention to
"the corner of Main &amp; Main," the new site development strategy of
national drugstore chains, the National Trust has put a spotlight on
Rockland, Massachusetts, and other historic sites threatened with
demolition by developers working for the chains.</P>

<P>This is a national crisis for historic preservation in small
towns: drug store corporations have changed their development plans
from building in commercial developments at the edges of towns to
siting new "big box" stores and parking lots on prominent corners in
town centers. They have shown a disregard for existing historic
buildings in acquiring new sites, and demolitions have included
commercial buildings, a Beaux-Arts post office, and period houses.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation has prepared a booklet
on the drug store developments - <A HREF="#Nth">see below.</A></P>

<P><B>AT RISK:</B></P>

<P>Rockland Historic District, two buildings listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, and one adjacent residence are
threatened for demolition for a Walgreens. These buildings form the
cornerstone of the historic district, and they include the Jenkins
Lane house at 5 Union Street, built in 1840 by a prominent shoe
manufacturer (and former state legislator), and the Richmond Lane
House at 21 Union Street, built in 1874 by another shoe manufacturer
and banker (both locations are in Rockland).</P>

<P>Such significant losses could jeopardize the status of the
National Register district, and they would have a serious negative
impact on the quality of the neighborhood and local property
values.</P>

<P><B>ALREADY LOST IN NEARBY TOWNS:</B></P>

<P>South Congregational Church in Brockton, dedicated in 1854, was
torn down in 1993 for a Walgreens (this was by Leo Noonan, the same
developer working for Walgreens on the Rockland project.) In an
article by Marilyn Hancock in the Brockton Enterprise (March 13,
1993), she writes "The former South Congregational Church, whose
future was hotly debated for two years, was the city's only federally
registered landmark and was considered a cornerstone of the South
Street Historic District in the Campello section of Brockton." As a
concession to the community, the bell was retrieved from an
architectural selvage dealer and mounted in front of the drugstore,
along with a plaque commemorating the historic church.</P>

<P><B>AT ISSUE:</B></P>

<P>Developers for the drug store chains are paying above market rate
for properties in high visibility locations. They have been
successfully targeting historic properties to acquire large parcels
in town centers. Two projects now under review will demolish
significant buildings from National Historic Districts and build
incompatible developments in their place.</P>

<P>The developers claim to be independent of the stores who are
signing on to lease the locations, and spokespeople for the national
corporations claim that there is no directive from their offices to
target historic buildings or districts for demolition. However, the
National Trust for Historic Preservation has noted this trend in New
England and in other regions. Walgreens corporate web site lists
criteria for development of new locations; it is a criteria drawn for
suburban sites in the midwest and west that is incompatible to the
historic character of New England town centers.</P>

<P>Contrary to the denial of corporate involvement, Leo Noonan,
developer for the proposed Rockland Walgreens, stated in a public
meeting February 17th, that "Walgreens looked at and turned down
other sites in Rockland. This is the site where they &#91;Walgreens
real estate executives&#93; thought they could be a success and a
value to the town." In his own words, the Rockland National Historic
District has been targeted by the corporation for demolition.</P>

<P><B>PROJECT STATUS - ROCKLAND:</B></P>

<P>On February 17, 1999, the Rockland Zoning Board unanimously
rejected the application for building the Walgreens development in a
residential R-3 zone, under the guise of a by law permitting
"neighborhood convenience stores" in the district. The developer
claimed that other commercial uses were grandfathered into the
current zoning and into the historic district setting a precedent
that would permit their proposed use of the site, and they also
requested a special permit for an oversized sign to be erected on the
location. The developer also claimed that there was "no interest" in
this area in a building of the architectural style of 21 Union Street
(a French Second Empire residence), but he found an interested
purchaser in Virginia willing to disassemble and relocate the
building. He felt this would help preserve the historic integrity of
the property. At this meeting it was noted that the "neighborhood
convenience store" exception is allowed in all residentially zoned
districts of Rockland, and if the precedent was set by Walgreens,
then 15,000 square foot retail boxes with parking for 70 cars could
be put on any residential street in town. Nearly 200 people turned
out to oppose the Walgreens proposal at the February 17, 1999 zoning
board meeting. Video tapes of this meeting are available. On March
19, 1999, the developer filed suit in District Court by the developer
against the Rockland Zoning Board to overturn their ruling.</P>

<P>Robert Looney, the attorney for the developer, has argued that the
zoning board's denial of their application "was error as a matter of
law and fact and that the Board exceeded its authority" and that "the
Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious." Mr. Looney, who is
directing the suit against the Rockland Zoning Board, himself serves
as an alternate on the East Bridgewater Zoning Board. His telephone
number is: 781-878-6600. The legal suit against the Rockland Zoning
Board was filed at District Court, Hingham Division (telephone
781-749-7000). Docket number 9958CV0207. The civil court clerk stated
that they "don't get many of these at the court, honestly." The court
hearing will be open to the public and media, but a date has not yet
been set as of 04/7/99. The architect for Walgreens, Steven Moeser of
Moeser &amp; Associates Architects of Harvard, Mass., lives and works
in a community known for having one of the strictest zoning
regulations against commercial development in Massachusetts. His
telephone number is: 978-456-6905. The developer is Leo Noonan, Susan
Elleen Realty Trust, 727 N. Montello St., Brockton, MA. telephone:

nationwide in 1999, with a goal of 3,000 stores by the year 2,000.

<P>"Better Models for Chain Drugstores"</P>

<P>"Over the past couple of years, chain drugstores have proliferated
across the country. The large, single-story, characterless
architecture and oversize parking lots have cropped up on America's
beloved Main Streets, as developers bulldoze historic buildings that
get in the way. Yet with the right planning and zoning regulations in
place, some communities have successfully worked with corporate
chains to integrate new drugstores into historic commercial
districts. This new publication from the National Trust's Information
series, "Better Models for Chain Drugstores," provides examples of
drugstore projects from across the country that complement the
historic character of the community.</P>

<P>"This booklet also suggests ways to implement
preservation-friendly regulations that empower communities to work
with the chains before the bulldozers come to town. Available Jan.
1999.</P>

<P>"The booklet costs $6.00 for individual copies including postage
and handling. Discounts are available for bulk orders.</P>
