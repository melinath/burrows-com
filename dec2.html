You see, sirs, we cannot quite imagine it; any more, perhaps, than
our forefathers of ancient London, living in the pretty, carefully
whitened houses, with the famous church and its huge spire rising
above them, - than they passing about the fair gardens running down
to the broad river, could have imagined a whole country or more
covered over with hideous hovels, big, middle-sized, and little,
which should one day be called London.</P>

<P>Sirs, I say this dead blank of the arts that I more than dread is
difficult even now to imagine; yet I fear that I must say that if it
does not come about, it will be owing to some turn of events which we
cannot at present foresee: but I hold that if it does happen, it will
only last for a time, that it will be but a burning up of the
gathered weeds, so that the field may bear more abundantly. I hold
that men would wake up after a while, and look round and find the
dulness unbearable, and begin once more inventing, imitating, and
imagining, as in earlier days.</P>

<P>That faith comforts me, and I can say calmly if the blank space
must happen, it must, and amidst its darkness the new seed must
sprout. So it has been before: birth, and hope scarcely conscious of
itself; then the flower and fruit of mastery, with hope more than
conscious enough, passing into insolence as decay follows ripeness;
and then - the new birth again.</P>

<P>Meantime it is the plain duty of all who look seriously on the
arts to do their best to save the world from what at the best will be
a loss, the result of ignorance and unwisdom; to prevent, in fact,
that most discouraging of all changes, the supplying the place of an
extinct brutality by a new one; nay, even if those who really care
for the arts are so weak and few that they can do nothing else, it
may be their business to keep alive some tradition, some memory of
the past, so that the new life when it comes may not waste itself
more than enough in fashioning wholly new forms for its new
spirit.</P>

<P>To what side then shall those turn for help, who really understand
the gain of a great art in the world, and the loss of peace and good
life that must follow from the lack of it? I think that they must
begin by acknowledging that the ancient art, the art of unconscious
intelligence, as one should call it, which began without a date, at
least so long ago as those strange and masterly scratchings on
mammoth-bones and the like found but the other day in the drift -
that this art of unconscious intelligence is all but dead; that what
little of it is left lingers among half-civilised nations, and is
growing coarser, feebler, less intelligent year by year; nay, is
mostly at the mercy of some commercial accident, such as the arrival
of a few shiploads of European dye-stuffs or a few dozen orders from
European merchants: this they must recognise, and must hope to see in
time its place filled by a new art of conscious intelligence, the
birth of wiser, simpler, freer ways of life than the world leads now,
than the world has ever led.</P>

<P>I said, to see this in time; I do not mean to say that our own
eyes will look upon it: it may be so far off, as indeed it seems to
some, that many would scarcely think it worth while thinking of: but
there are some of us who cannot turn our faces to the wall, or sit
deedless because our hope seems somewhat dim; and, indeed, I think
that while the signs of the last decay of the old art with all the
evils that must follow in its train are only too obvious about us, so
on the other hand there are not wanting signs of the new dawn beyond
that possible night of the arts, of which I have before spoken: this
sign chiefly, that there are some few at least who are heartily
discontented with things as they are, and crave for something better,
or at least some promise of it - this best of signs: for I suppose
that if some half-dozen men at any time earnestly set their hearts on
something coming about which is not discordant with nature, it will
come to pass one day or other; because it is not by accident that an
idea comes into the heads of a few; rather they are pushed on, and
forced to speak or act by something stirring in the heart of the
world which would otherwise be left without expression.</P>

<P>By what means then shall those work who long for reform in the
arts, and whom shall they seek to kindle into eager desire for
possession of beauty, and better still, for the development of the
faculty that creates beauty?</P>

<P>People say to me often enough: If you want to make your art
succeed and flourish, you must make it the fashion: a phrase which I
confess annoys me: for they mean by it that I should spend one day
over my work to two days in trying to convince rich, and supposed
influential people, that they cared very much for what they do not
care in the least, so that it may happen according to the proverb:
`Bell-wether took the leap and we all went over:' well, such advisers
are right if they are content with the thing lasting but a little
while; say till you can make a little money - if you don't get
pinched by the door shutting too quickly: otherwise they are wrong:
the people they are thinking of have too many strings to their bow
and can turn their backs too easily on a thing that fails, for it to
be safe work trusting to their whims: it is not their fault, they
cannot help it, but they have no chance of spending time enough over
the arts to know anything practical of them, and they must of
necessity be in the hands of those who spend their time in pushing
fashion this way and that for their own advantage.</P>

<P>Sirs, there is no help to be got out of these latter, or those who
let themselves be led by them: the only real help for the decorative
arts must come from those who work in them; nor must they be led,
they must lead.</P>

<P>You whose hands make those things that should be works of art, you
must be all artists and good artists before the public at large can
take real interest in such things; and when you have become so, I
promise you that you shall lead the fashion; fashion shall follow
your hands obediently enough.</P>

<P>That is the only way in which we can get a supply of intelligent
popular art: a few artists of the kind so-called now, what can they
do working in the teeth of difficulties thrown in their way by what
is called Commerce, but which should be called greed of money,
working helplessly among the crowd of those who are ridiculously
called manufacturers, i.e. handicraftsmen, though the more part of
them never did a stroke of hand-work in their lives, and are nothing
better than capitalists and salesmen. - What can these grains of sand
do, I say, amidst the enormous mass of work turned out every year
which professes in some way to be decorative art, but the decoration
of which no one heeds except the salesmen who have to do with it, and
are hard put to it to supply the cravings of the public for something
new, not for something pretty?</P>

<P>The remedy I repeat is plain if it can be applied; the
handicraftsman, left behind by the artist when the arts sundered,
must come up with him, must work side by side with him: apart from
the difference between a great master and a scholar, apart from the
differences of the natural bent of men's minds, which would make one
man an imitative, and another an architectural or decorative artist,
there should be no difference between those employed on strictly
ornamental work; and the body of artists dealing with this should
quicken with their art all makers of things into artists also, in
proportion to the necessities and uses of the things they would
make.</P>

<P>I know what stupendous difficulties social and economical there
are in the way of this; yet I think that they seem to be greater than
they are: and of one thing I am sure, that no real living decorative
art is possible if this is impossible.</P>

<P>It is not impossible, on the contrary it is certain to come about,
if you are at heart desirous to quicken the arts; if the world will,
for the sake of beauty and decency, sacrifice some of the things it
is so busy over (many of which I think are not very worthy of its
trouble) art will begin to grow again; as for those difficulties
above mentioned, some of them I know will in any case melt away
before the steady change of the relative conditions of men; the rest,
reason and resolute attention to the laws of nature, which are also
the laws of art, will dispose of little by little: once more the way
will not be far to seek, if the will be with us.</P>
