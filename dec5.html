And Science - we have loved her well, and followed her diligently,
what will she do? I fear she is so much in the pay of the
counting-house, the counting-house and the drill-sergeant, that she
is too busy, and will for the present do nothing. Yet there are
matters which I should have thought easy for her, say for example
teaching Manchester how to consume its own smoke, or Leeds how to get
rid of its superfluous black dye without turning it into the river,
which would be as much worth her attention as the production of the
heaviest of heavy black silks, or the biggest of useless guns.
Anyhow, however it be done, unless people care about carrying on
their business without making the world hideous, how can they care
about art? I know it will cost much both of time and money to better
these things even a little; but I do not see how these can be better
spent than in making life cheerful and honourable for others and for
ourselves; and the gain of good life to the country at large that
would result from men seriously setting about the bettering of the
decency of our big towns would be priceless, even if nothing
specially good befell the arts in consequence: I do not know that it
would; but I should begin to think matters hopeful if men turned
their attention to such things, and I repeat, that unless they do so,
we can scarcely even begin with any hope our endeavours for the
bettering in the Arts.</P>

<P>Until something or other is done to give all men some pleasure for
the eyes and rest for the mind in the aspect of their own and their
neighbours' houses, until the contrast is less disgraceful between
the fields where beasts live and the streets where men live, I
suppose that the practice of the arts must be mainly kept in the
hands of a few highly cultivated men, who can go often to beautiful
places, whose education enables them, in the contemplation of the
past glories of the world, to shut out from their view the everyday
squalors that the most of men move in. Sirs, I believe that art has
such sympathy with cheerful freedom, open-heartedness, and reality,
so much she sickens under selfishness and luxury, that she will not
live thus isolated and exclusive. I will go further than this, and
say that on such terms I do not wish her to live. I protest that it
would be a sham to an honest artist to enjoy what he had huddled up
to himself of such art, as it would be for a rich man to sit and eat
dainty food amongst starving soldiers in a beleaguered fort.</P>

<P>I do not want art for a few, any more than education for a few, or
freedom for a few.</P>

<P>No, rather than art should live this poor thin life among a few
exceptional men, despising those beneath them for an ignorance for
which they themselves are responsible, for a brutality that they will
not struggle with, - rather than this, I would that the world should
indeed sweep away all art for a while, as I said before I thought it
possible she might do: rather than the wheat should rot in the
miser's granary, I would that the earth had it, that it might yet
have a chance to quicken in the dark.</P>

<P>I have a sort of faith, though, that this clearing away of all art
will not happen, that men will get wiser, as well as more learned;
that many of the intricacies of life, on which we now pride ourselves
more than enough, partly because they are new, partly because they
have come with the gain of better things, will be cast aside as
having played their part, and being useful no longer. I hope that we
shall have leisure from war, - war commercial, as well as war of the
bullet and the bayonet; leisure from the knowledge that darkens
counsel; leisure above all from the greed of money, and the craving
for that overwhelming distinction that money now brings: I believe
that, as we have even now partly achieved LIBERTY, so we shall
achieve EQUALITY, and best of all, FRATERNITY, and so have leisure
from poverty and all its griping, sordid cares.</P>

<P>Then, having leisure from all these things, amidst renewed
simplicity of life we shall have leisure to think about our work,
that faithful daily companion, which no man any longer will venture
to call the Curse of labour: for surely then we shall be happy in it,
each in his place, no man grudging at another; no one bidden to be
any man's servant, everyone scorning to be any man's master: men will
then assuredly be happy in their work, and that happiness will
assuredly bring forth decorative, noble, popular art.</P>

<P>That art will make our streets as beautiful as the woods, as
elevating as the mountain-sides: it will be a pleasure and a rest,
and not a weight upon the spirits to come from the open country into
a town; every man's house will be fair and decent, soothing to his
mind and helpful to his work: all the works of man that we live
amongst and handle will be in harmony with nature, will be reasonable
and beautiful: yet all will be simple and inspiriting, not childish
or enervating; for as nothing of beauty and splendour that man's mind
and hand may compass shall be wanted from our public buildings, so in
no private dwelling will there be any signs of waste, pomp, or
insolence, and every man will have his share of the best.</P>

<P>It is a dream, you may say, of what has never been and never will
be: true, it has been, and therefore, since the world is alive and
moving yet, my hope is the greater that it one day will be: true, it
is a dream; but dreams have before now come about of things so good
and necessary to us, that we scarcely think of them more than of the
daylight: though once people had to live without them, without even
the hope of them.</P>

<P>Anyhow, dream as it is, I pray you to pardon my setting it before
you, for it lies at the bottom of all my work in the Decorative Arts,
nor will it ever be out of my thoughts: and I am here with you
tonight to ask you to help me in realising this dream, this hope.</P>
