<P>In New York a taste for white, relieved if possible with gold,
came in from France, for France has always been the mistress of taste
for New Yorkers. If not white, then panels or whole walls of the most
delicate tints, the practical reason for the choice being that the
rooms so decorated "light up well at night." And so they do, and if
that were all that is to be considered, the verdict would be
unquestionably in favor of this mode of decoration. Only we shall
still insist that the whole room should be in harmony, and that
violent contrasts between the curtains, carpets, and the coverings of
the chairs and sofas, and the walls and ceilings, should not be
permitted. The main objection to this whiteness is its want of
adaptation to the requirements of our climate. We Americans are great
travelers, we dislike stagnation, and as soon as the weather permits,
we are off from the city, to the country, to the sea-side, to
watering places; and the town-house is deserted. If we lived in our
rooms steadily all the year, it might be as important to have them
cool-looking in summer as warm-looking in winter, but certainly it is
of more importance for us to think of the cold season from November,
or even from October, to May or June, (for May is a sulky month in
spite of the poets) rather than of the rest of the year.</P>

<P>But, times change, and what was possible to a former generation,
is impossible for us of a later time. Even if the old-fashioned
simplicity - bareness, as we call it - were agreeable to us, it would
be difficult to maintain it, so greatly has the condition of the
market for beautiful things and things combining use and ornament,
changed within a very few years. The things that go to the furnishing
of a house are so vastly improved with us, and things once rare are
now become so common - either the things themselves, or their
faithful copies - that it is a comparatively easy matter, not even
calling for much money, for people in ordinarily good circumstances
to have their rooms looking not merely comfortable but handsome.
Carpet have always been the rule in American houses, but then Eastern
rugs were long scarce, or wholly unknown: now, however, they are to
be had in abundance, even good ones are within easy reach, and those
the connoisseur calls poor are, many of them, not to be despised.
Within two or three years there has been a great improvement in the
general character of our furniture - of course, no matter what the
fashion is, there will always be dealers who will give it a vulgar
tone, either loud or insipid - but, whereas two or three years ago,
pretty, well-designed, elegant furniture was only to be had in shops
whose dearness forbade them to all but the rich, it is now to be had
without difficulty, so rapidly does improvement shoot ahead in our
country when once it has got a start. Within a few months I have
heard of a firm in our city that offers for sale furniture for
cottages and small houses which has been designed expressly to meet
the wants of persons with more taste than money. Very good copies of
our colonial furniture are now to be had in the shops; but, what is
wanted is, things that are more in keeping with our own ways of
living and with the general style of our house-furnishing. Excellent
as our architects are, they have as yet been allowed too little
liberty in designing the furniture for the houses they build us, and
in decorating their interior. Not only are clients becoming wise and
perceiving how much to their advantage it will be to have the inside
of their houses in harmony with the outside, but the
furniture-makers, besieged by the fairer part of the public, are
calling on the architects for help in satisfying the improved taste
of their customers.</P>

<P>In the general course of improvement, the answering of supply to
demand, wall-paper have not lagged behind. We have, now, in America
as wide a field to choose from as can be found anywhere. English
papers, from the most conservative and respectable patterns to the
latest artistic growth, are found in all our best shop, and Paris
itself cannot show more pretty, coquettish, elegant, stately, rich
designs at home, than she send New York every year from her
overflowing store.</P>

<P>It may be said, in passing, that France makes no account of one of
the prime articles in the creed of the modern English and American
schools of Decorative Art, that natural representation of flowers and
fruits, and for that matter, imitations of all sorts, should be
sedulously avoided. The French permit themselves full liberty in this
matter, imitate any thing and every thing they can force into the
service of decoration, and when they feel like it, paint flowers and
fruits on wall-papers, or weave them into silks, or print them upon
chintzes, with such grace and truth to nature, as to deceive the very
elect. We Americans, being I suppose at the root more akin to the
English than to the French, have blindly accepted the English dictum
in this matter, and look upon wall-papers with any but set
conventional patterns and somber colors, as vulgar, or as they say,
"low form" - for we prefer even English cockney slang to our own. It
was from the English we learned to make our dining-rooms dark, and to
load them with heavy furniture; there being in reality, not good
reason to be given - none at least that I could ever hear of - why
dining-rooms should be any darker or drearier than drawing-rooms. So
with bed-rooms. 'Tis as much as a man's reputation for good taste is
worth, to confess that he likes to see a pretty flowered paper on a
bed-room wall; and one can hardly estimate the courage it would take
to own that one liked an old-fashioned landscape-paper in a hall-way
or in a dining room.</P>

<P>It was not always so in England however, and one of the pleasant
features of the so-called "Queen Anne" style that we hear so much
about now-a-days, is its freedom from pedantry, its willingness to
admit into its scheme of ornamentation almost anything that is
intrinsically pretty or graceful. Thus, in furniture, we are free to
empty miniature architectural forms - colonnettes, pilasters,
pediments, (even broken ones); and one can, if we choose, paint the
papers and stuffs with which we cover our walls and furniture, with
wreaths of flowers and festoons of fruits; with groups of figures
from poetry or history; with grotesques and arabesques from Rome and
Pompeii, passed through the brains of Louis XIV's Frenchmen or of
Anne's Englishmen; with landscapes even, pretty pastorals set in
frameworks of wreaths or ribbons, or more simply arranged like
irregular spots in rows of alternate subjects.</P>

<P>To-day we have the choice between this careless freedom from
aesthetic restraint, and a docile obedience to certain formal rules,
rules sensible enough, no doubt, and when carried out, producing good
and reasonable effects, pleasing to the greater number of people, and
quite as much "the fashion" as the other. But is seems to me pretty
well settled now - thanks to the revived freedom and naturalness of
the so-called "Queen Anne" style, and to the far more artistic art of
the Japanese with freedom and naturalness equally its characteristics
- that the classic laws of symmetry and unity are no longer to be
considered the absolute rulers of the field of decorative art. They
have their place, and they deserve our respect as much ever they did,
but we are at liberty to choose where we will employ them, and where
we will not.</P>

<P>In covering our walls with paper, we have to take one of two
courses. We must consider, whether the paper is to serve as a
background for pictures and ornamental objects, or, whether it is to
be treated as an ornament itself. If it is to serve as a background
for pictures, then we are to consider what will suit them best, what
will at once keep them in their place, and bring them out: but is an
error, I think, to suppose, as some people do, that a "quiet" paper
is what is wanted for this purpose. A "quiet" paper must be suited
like any other to the whole room, and no paper is "good" in itself
alone, its goodness, like that of human beings, is entirely relative
and depends upon what it is wanted for. If the pictures are dark and
rich-looking, in gold frames, they will be suitably backed by a sober
background in a brocade or arabesque pattern, one that will suggest
the silks or leathers employed for such purposes in older times. Such
a paper would indeed be "quiet," but it would not be dull or
undecided, which is what people in general usually mean when they use
the expression, "a quiet paper." Now, dull or undecided, a wall-paper
should never be. On the contrary it ought always to be decided in its
tint - a very different thing from being "staring" or "pronounced" -
and it ought to harmonize with the pictures or ornaments; it should
diffuse, so to speak, the tone of the objects that hang upon it over
the whole wall, but it should be subordinate to them, neither
over-crowing them or making them look like isolated spots.</P>

<P>But, the pictures may be of quite another sort from those I have
described. They may be photographs or prints or delicate
water-colors, and in this case the same rule will hold - that the
wall-paper should be one that will accord with the general tone of
the drawings and photographs. Papers with loose flowing patterns,
damasks, or arabesques in the lighter greens, grays, blues, reds and
yellows will harmonize with such pictures and show them at their
best.</P>

<P>Here I may say that in this matter of photographs and prints a
good deal depends upon the way in which they are framed and mounted.
If this is done in the old fashion with wide white margins and dark
frames - black or brown, with or without lines and ornaments in gold
- the effect of the whole will be light and characterless; at any
rate one requiring a light background to accord with it. If, on the
other hand, the photographs and drawings show no white mounts at all
but are surrounded with flat and not too narrow gold mounts, and with
frames of dark wood or of wood gilded in the grain and unburnished,
the effect may be as rich as that of oil paintings, and the
background required will be sober or rich, to correspond.</P>

<P>It may be modestly said that few people know how much decorative
effect may be got out of photographs, etchings and engravings. Only,
these last must be of a certain sort. As usually treated, they are
not effective at all, and many people object to them absolutely and
will not frame them. As I have said however, and every artist will, I
am sure, uphold me in it, they can be made of great importance in the
decorative scheme of the room, and this simply by taking their own
general tone as the key-note and working up from that to higher tones
in the scale. Of course I am now speaking of photographs that are not
"vignetted," but photographs of pictures that are themselves
pictorial and come vigorously up to their boundaries on all sides.
Photographs such as these from the pictures of the best Italian
painters, as well as from Holbein, Velasquez and Reynolds (though the
old mezzotints from Reynolds, Gainsborough and Raeburn are better
than any photographs) may now be procured with ease and at prices
within reach of very humble purses, and when framed as they should
be, and backed by a wall-paper that is suited to them, they may hold
their own against more pretentious pictures less harmoniously
presented.</P>

<P>We have next to think of the division of the wall. This is a
matter of the first importance in decoration and the modern
wall-papers give us a great help in producing good effects with a
very inconsiderable expenditure of money.</P>

<P>If the room be a high one, such as we ordinarily find in city
houses, the wall will look better divided into three parts, a dado or
wainscot, the wall proper, and a frieze, so called, just below the
ceiling. The <A NAME=dado></A> dado - a word whose etymology I cannot
trace, perhaps a corruption of "dais" - plays a part equally
decorative and useful. The older name is wainscot, and means
wall-protector, a covering of wood laid against the stone or brick
wall for warmth and comfort. Originally, and this before plastering
was employed, the object of wainscot was purely useful, though
according to the means of the house-builder it was carried up to a
greater or a lesser height. Plaster was introduced as a substitute
for wainscot, cheaper and more easily applied to the wall, and as
wood grew scarcer, people ceased to employ it at all for sheathing
the inside walls, the only vestige of it being the so-called
mop-board (to keep the scrubbing-woman's mop from the plaster, or
wall-paper,) base-board, skirting-board as it is variously called. It
is a thousand pities the old paneled wainscot was ever given up.
Those who have seen rooms in old houses about Boston and Philadelphia
with the lower half of the parlor walls covered with a wainscot
divided agreeably to architectural taste into its own base, styles,
panels and moulded cornice; the mantle-piece of wood, with cupboards
and arches at either side; with a wooden cornice running round the
whole room and with low seats in the windows - the window-seat, a
feature entirely lost to us in these days of thin outer walls - and
then the wall-space that was left by this mode of treatment, covered
with a landscape-paper, or a paper with large decorative flowers -
peonies, hollyhocks, poppies, tulips, softly bright, toned down to
chime with the light colors of the paint - whoever has seen such a
room as this, must think we have gained nothing in the look of
comfort, at least, by discarding the old fashion. And indeed, we show
our good taste by coming back to the old style once more, if not in
actual wood-work, at least in the devices that produce a similar
effect.</P>
