<P>Yet, granted the will, and though the way lies ready to us, we
must not be discouraged if the journey seem barren enough at first,
nay, not even if things seem to grow worse for a while: for it is
natural enough that the very evil which has forced on the beginning
of reform should look uglier while, on the one hand, life and wisdom
are building up the new, and on the other, folly and deadness are
hugging the old to them.</P>

<P>In this, as in all other matters, lapse of time will be needed
before things seem to straighten, and the courage and patience that
does not despise small things lying ready to be done; and care and
watchfulness, lest we begin to build the wall ere the footings are
well in, and always through all things much humility that is not
easily cast down by failure, that seeks to be taught, and is ready to
learn.</P>

<P>For your teachers, they must be Nature and History: as for the
first that you must learn of it is so obvious that I need not dwell
upon that now: hereafter, when I have to speak more of matters of
detail, I may have to speak of the manner in which you must learn of
Nature. As to the second, I do not think that any man but one of the
highest genius could do anything in these days without much study of
ancient art, and even he would be much hindered if he lacked it. If
you think that this contradicts what I said about the death of that
ancient art, and the necessity I implied for an art that should be
characteristic of the present day, I can only say that, in these
times of plenteous knowledge and meagre performance, if we do not
study the ancient work directly and learn to understand it, we shall
find ourselves influenced by the feeble work all round us, and shall
be copying the better work through the copyists and without
understanding it, which will by no means bring about intelligent art.
Let us therefore study it wisely, be taught by it, kindled by it; all
the while determining not to imitate or repeat it, to have either no
art at all, or an art which we have made our own.</P>

<P>Yet I am almost brought to a stand-still when bidding you to study
nature and the history of art, by remembering that this is London,
and what it is like: how can I ask working-men passing up and down
these hideous streets day by day to care about beauty? If it were
politics, we must care about that; or science, you could wrap
yourselves up in the study of facts, no doubt, without much caring
what goes on about you - but beauty! do you not see what terrible
difficulties beset art, owing to a long neglect of art - and neglect
of reason, too, in this matter? It is such a heavy question by what
effort, by what dead-lift, you can thrust this difficulty from you,
that I must perforce set it aside for the present, and must at least
hope that the study of history and its monuments will help you
somewhat herein. If you can really fill your minds with memories of
great works of art, and great times of art, you will, I think, be
able to a certain extent to look through the aforesaid ugly
surroundings, and will be moved to discontent of what is careless and
brutal now, and will, I hope, at last be so much discontented with
what is bad, that you will determine to bear no longer that
short-sighted, reckless brutality of squalor that so disgraces our
intricate civilization.</P>

<P>Well, at any rate, London is good for this, that it is well off
for museums, - which I heartily wish were to be got at seven days in
the week instead of six; and certainly any of us who may have any
natural turn for art must get more help from frequenting them than
one can well say. It is true, however, that people need some
preliminary instruction before they can get all the good possible to
be got from the prodigious treasures of art possessed by the country
in that form: there also one sees things in a piece-meal way: nor can
I deny that there is something melancholy about a museum, such a tale
of violence, destruction, and carelessness, as its treasured scraps
tell us.</P>

<P>But moreover you may sometimes have an opportunity of studying
ancient art in a narrower but a more intimate, a more kindly form,
the monuments of our land: Sometimes only, since we live in the
middle of this world of brick and mortar, and there is little else
left us amidst it, except the ghost of the glorious church at
Westminster and the Hall beside it: but when we can get beyond that
smoky world, there out in the country we may see they works of our
fathers yet alive amidst the very nature they were wrought into, and
of which they are so completely a part: for there indeed if anywhere,
in the English country, in the days when people cared about such
things, was there a full sympathy between the works of man, and the
land they were made for: - the land is a little land, Sirs, too much
shut up within the narrow seas, as it seems, to have much space for
swelling into hugeness: there are no great wastes overwhelming in
their dreariness, no great solitudes of forests, no terrible
untrodden mountain-walls: all is measured, mingled, varied, gliding
easily one thing into another: little rivers, little plains,
swelling, speedily-changing uplands, all beset with handsome orderly
trees; little hills, little mountains, netted over with the walls of
sheep-walks: all is little; yet not foolish and blank, but serious
rather, and abundant of meaning for such as choose to seek it: it is
neither prison, nor palace, but a decent home.</P>

<P>All which I neither praise nor blame, but say that so it is: some
people praise this homeliness overmuch, as if the land were the very
axle-tree of the world; so do not I, nor any unblinded by pride in
themselves and all that belongs to them: others there are who scorn
it and the tameness of it: not I any the more: though it would indeed
be hard if there were nothing else in the world, no wonders, no
terrors, no unspeakable beauties: yet when we think what a small part
of the world's history, past, present, and to come, is this land we
live in, and how much smaller still in the history of the arts, and
yet how our forefathers clung to it, and with what care and pains
they adorned it, this unromantic, uneventful-looking land of England,
surely by this too our hearts may be touched and our hope
quickened.</P>

<P>For as was the land, such was the art of it while folk yet
troubled themselves about such things; it strove little to impress
people either by pomp or ingenuity: not unseldom it fell into
commonplace, rarely it rose into majesty; yet was it never
oppressive, never a slave's nightmare or an insolent boast: and at
its best it had an inventiveness, an individuality, that grander
styles have never overpassed: its best too, and that was in its very
heart, was given as freely to the yeoman's house, and the humble
village church, as to the lord's palace or the mighty cathedral:
never coarse, though often rude enough, sweet, natural and
unaffected, an art of peasants rather than of merchant-princes or
courtiers, it must be a hard heart, I think, that does not love it:
whether a man has been born among it like ourselves, or has come
wonderingly on its simplicity from all the grandeur over-seas. A
peasant art, I say, and it clung fast to the life of the people, and
still lived among the cottagers and yeomen in many parts of the
country while the big houses were being built `French and fine':
Still lived also in many a quaint pattern of loom and printing-block,
and embroiderer's needle, while over-seas stupid pomp had
extinguished all nature and freedom, and art was become, in France
especially, the mere expression of that successful and exultant
rascality which in the flesh no long time afterwards went down into
the pit for ever.</P>

<P>Such was the English art, whose history is in a sense at your
doors, grown scarce indeed, and growing scarcer indeed, and growing
scarcer year by year, not only through greedy destruction, of which
there is certainly less than there used to be, but also through the
attacks of another foe, called now-a-days `restoration.'</P>

<P>I must not make a long story about this, but also I cannot quite
pass it over, since I have pressed on you the study of these ancient
monuments. Thus the matter stands; these old buildings have been
altered and added to century after century, often beautifully, always
historically; their very value, a great part of it, lay in that: they
have suffered too almost always from neglect, often from violence
(that latter also a piece of history often far from uninteresting),
but ordinary obvious mending would almost always have kept them
standing, pieces of nature and of history.</P>

<P>But of late years a great uprising of ecclesiastical zeal,
coinciding with a great increase of study, and consequently of
knowledge of mediaeval architecture, has driven people into spending
on these buildings, not merely with the purpose of repairing them, of
keeping them safe, clean, and wind and water-tight, but also of
`restoring' them to some ideal state of perfection; sweeping away if
possible all signs of what has befallen them at least since the
Reformation, and often since dates much earlier: this has sometimes
been done with much disregard of art and entirely from ecclesiastical
zeal, but oftener it has been well meant enough as regards art: yet
you will not have listened to what I have said to-night if you do not
see that from my point of view this restoration must be as impossible
to bring about as the attempt at it is destructive to the buildings
so dealt with: I scarcely like to think what a great part of them
have been made nearly useless to students of art and history: unless
you knew a great deal about architecture you perhaps would scarce
understand what terrible damage has been done by that dangerous
`little knowledge' in this matter, but this I think is easy to be
understood, that to deal recklessly with valuable (and national)
monuments which, when once gone, can never be replaced by any
splendour of modern art, is doing a very sorry service to the
State.</P>

<P>You will see by all that I have said on this study of ancient art
that I mean by education herein something much wider than the
teaching of a definite art in schools of design, and that it must be
something that we must do more or less for ourselves: I mean by it a
systematic concentration of our thoughts on the matter, a studying of
it in all ways, careful and laborious practice of it, and a
determination to do nothing but what is known to be good in
workmanship and design.</P>

<P>Of course, however, both as an instrument of that study we have
been speaking of, as well as of the practice of the arts, all
handicraftsmen should be taught to draw very carefully; as indeed all
people should be taught drawing who are not physically incapable of
learning it: but the art of drawing so taught would not be the art of
designing, but only a means toward this end, general capability in
dealing with the arts.</P>

<P>For I wish specially to impress this upon you, that designing
cannot be taught at all in a school: continued practice will help a
man who is naturally a designer, continual notice of nature and of
art: no doubt those who have some faculty for designing are still
numerous, and they want from a school certain technical teaching,
just as they want tools: in these days also, when the best school,
the school of successful practice going on around you, is at such a
low ebb, they do undoubtedly want instruction in the history of the
arts: these two things schools of design can give: but the royal road
of a set of rules, will lead nowhere; - or, let us rather say, to
beginning again.</P>
