		<h1><font size="5">Shipping Charges &amp; Return Policy</font></h1>
		<strong>Minimum charge is $20.00;</strong><strong> add $2.00 per item over 5 items for shipping and handling.<br>
				For yardage goods, please add 50 cents per <b>1/2 yard.<br>
			</b></strong>Most shipments are made within one week of order.  Please allow 4 to 6 weeks for delivery<br>
		<p><strong>Note on Sizes:<br>
			</strong>All of our lace products are made on antique Jacquard machinery in a process that involves many complex steps to weave and finish. Due to the nature of the production of Nottingham Lace, there can be a 2% to 3% variance in the finished size of the panels. Our catalog lists the sizes set as standards in mill specifications, but small differences can occur which are not considered defects. Variations are most noteable in the longest length panels. If you are planning on altering the length of a panel, it is recommended that you wash the panel first and then measure up from the bottom to ensure the lengths of each piece. Quality control at our mill is excellent, but occasionally an error occurs in packaging which results in our inadvertently shipping a replacement at no additional cost upon receipt of the returned product.</p>
		<P><strong>Return Policy:<br>
			</strong>Returns because of defects will be replaced or the purchase price will be refunded.  Other returns must be made within 90 days of purchase, and there will be a handling charge of <strong>10%.</strong> Shipping charges are not refunded. Custom hemmed curtains are not returnable unless defective. We request that you open as few packages as possible if you are considering a return. Cut yardage goods are not returnable for a refund.<HR>
