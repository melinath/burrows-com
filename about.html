Studio encompasses the collection of Arts &amp; Crafts Movement
designs offered by J.R. Burrows &amp; Company. Styled under the
direction of <A HREF="john.html">John Burrows</A>, the designs are representative of the Aesthetic Movement and the first generation of the Anglo-American Arts &amp; Crafts Movement from the 1880s and 90s. </P>
        <p>In 1880s New England the Colonial Revival was fused with Arts &amp; Crafts sensitivity and known as the Old Colony Style. Our patterns have been used in some of the most famous Shingle Style, Queen Anne Revival and Colonial Revival homes of the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Burrows Studio also offers designs in the post-1900 American Arts &amp; Crafts style and is introducing Art Deco designs from the 1920s.</p>
        <p>Our pattern designs, drawn from nature and following the principals of moral design of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, represent the finest aspects of simplicity and refinement in line and coloring. See our <A HREF="design.html">Design List</A> for the full
offering, and <A HREF="quote.html">Design Quotations</A> for further
ideas from the Victorian era.</p>
        <p>Among the wallpaper designers whose work is represented in the Burrows Studio collection is <a href="cw.html">Candace Wheeler</a>, whose firm, Associated Artists, was a leader in pattern design in the 1880s and 90s and Jennie B. Jones, an art educator and designer from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. New additions forthcoming to the collection are from the studio of German-American designers Mitschke and Huizeng (c. 1910s - 1930s) and current designs in the Arts &amp; Crafts tradition by <a href="john.html">John Burrows</a>.</p>
