<P>The design of the frieze should not be too prominent nor formal:
some of the best that I have seen have been of a paper not expressly
intended for such a use, covered well over with flowers not too
large. The object of the frieze is to make a colored band or, rather,
a tinted band under the cornice, and to simply modify the height of
the wall. This latter purpose would be defeated rather than assisted
by a formal pattern with large and brilliant figures, for such a
frieze would pull the ceiling, figuratively speaking, over our ears,
and beside would kill the effect of the main portion of the wall.
But, here as everywhere, we have to consider things in their
relations, and some of the New York parlors, especially those in the
old-fashioned houses, are so large and empty-looking, even when
furnished, that we have to give the walls heroic doses of ornament in
order to keep them down.</P>

<P>A use to which wall-paper is seldom (in my experience) put in New
York, is the covering of ceilings; and yet it is often so employed in
Boston, in the houses built and decorated by the younger architects
there, and employed too with excellent effect. White ceilings are, or
ought to be, disagreeable to everybody, and yet in the want of
decorative talent among our house-painters already complained of - as
for the professional fresco-painters, their work is always
irredeemably bad - wall-paper is the only substitute that is within
the means of most people. Of course, if artists like Messrs. Louis C.
Tiffany and Samuel Colman will undertake the commission, there is no
more to be said. We are not now thinking of exceptions however, but
of the general rule. And certainly for the most of us, covering the
ceiling with well-chosen wall-papers arranged in a large central
field with a good border, is an expedient to be commended. The whole
should be kept flat, however - at least, in nine cases out of ten, it
should be so - but in the tenth case there is sure to come along a
decorative genius who will do the wrong thing and make us think it
the right thing. But we are not to reckon on miracles. We have to
take the work-a-day world as we find it, and our ceilings must be
covered as we can best contrive it with the help of our own taste and
the resources of the paper-dealers' shelves. It ought to be difficult
to go astray in the matter, considering how plentiful is the supply
of papers suitable for all purposes - pretty and elegant, rich and
fanciful, sober and retiring - designs on which all the skill of the
time we live in has been expended to make them satisfactory to the
most exacting taste.</P>

<P>The important step has been taken by the house for which this
tract is written. Messrs. Warren, Fuller &amp; Co., of employing
American artists to make them designs for wall-papers of their own
manufacture. Messrs. Louis C. Tiffany and Samuel Colman, two artists
whose work has enjoyed a great deal of popular favor, and whose
experience and surrounding have made them acquainted with the
elegancies and refinements of our modern life, and familiarized them
with all the best designs of the East as well as of Europe, have
accepted the commission, and for some time have been engaged in
studies and experiments, the results of which are shown, in part, in
certain of the illustrations bound up with these pages. It seems to
me that this is beginning in the right way. Owing to the practical
difficulties in the matter, the difficulties that an artist whose
sole business has been to paint pictures on squares of canvas, must
find in taking up design as an art, it was not to be expected that
even artists working with the advantages enjoyed by Messrs. Tiffany
and Colman would find their way altogether smooth. It was necessary
to try a great many experiments before they could feel satisfied to
submit anything to the public, and the papers they have designed and
which Messrs. Warren, Fuller &amp; Co. have manufactured, are
certainly well worth the attention of all persons interested in the
growth of the arts of design in this country. We wish those
intelligent and public-spirited citizens who, beside the liking they
have for art itself, feel also a generous concern for the part
America is to play in its development, and who are trying to bring
about a time when we shall not go abroad for arts that can as well be
produced at home - we wish these fellow-citizens of ours would see
the truth, for it is a truth - that the way to encourage the healthy,
normal growth of any form of art, the true and only way to teach it
is to set it at some actual work intended to be paid for, and to be
worth paying for. I never did have any faith in art-schools, whether
supported by the money of a nation or by that of individuals, and if
the matter is well looked into, it will be found that progress in any
art has always come from the experience gained in carrying out
regular business-commissions, or in supplying actual needs of men and
women.</P>

<P>It was in this matter-of-fact utilitarian way that the arts of
painting and sculpture came to be born, and it was in doing such
useful, needed work that they grew and developed their magnificent
strength in Italy; and when the time came for the birth of the more
avowedly useful arts, the art of pottery, for example, these grew up
and flourished without any other aid whatever than the universal law
of supply-and-demand gave them. Even the princes patronized the
potteries because they wanted the things the potter made, and not
from any sentimental feeling of patriotism. They saw it was better
every way to have the things that had hitherto been imported, made at
home by their own people, so that their own treasuries could be
filled by the profits of trade. There never was talk heard of the
necessity for schools-of-design in any country where art really
flourished. There was, no doubt, a capacity for what we call
art-production, a capacity that is found much more in some people
than in others, but it was never developed anywhere where it did
exist, nor created anywhere where it did not exist, by means of
schools, but only by actual experience in serious work.</P>

<P>Therefore it is, that, the undertaking of the Messrs. Warren,
Fuller &amp; Co., is beginning at the right end. They have invited
artists to design them wall-papers that shall have decided artistic
qualities, and yet shall be suited to actual needs, and that shall
command a place in the market. They want to make a breach in the wall
of old ideas and fashions of the past, that hedges us in, and to
create something that shall have a unborrowed, individual look.</P>

<P>"But," says one, "What is the use? Why try to compete with French
wall-papers, the best and most beautiful in the world, and suited to
every taste." Who, then, I ask, set the French going, and were there
not French folks who threw cold water on French enterprise at the
start? No, I doubt if there were, for the French have always had the
good common-sense to be true to themselves, to encourage home genius,
home talent, and home manufacture; and French gothic architecture,
French painting and sculpture, French gardening, French tapestry,
porcelain, faiance, silks, fashion - each has led the race in its
turn, because there was nobody to disparage it, and no one to listen
to disparagement had it been offered. There must be a beginning in
the improvement of the decorative arts as in everything, and, for my
part, I should be glad to see it come here as in everything, and, for
my part, I should be glad to see it come here as it came in England
and France in the days before art-schools were invented, to the
deadening of all art-instinct, and the extinction of all originality.
In another field, the Messrs. Warren, Fuller &amp; Co. are doing the
same service for the decorative arts here in America, that the
Wedgewoods did in England, and if the artists will only second these
gentlemen with their best aid, they can afford to wait for the
public, knowing that they must buy their wall-papers if they are
handsome, and that they will buy them in case they take their fancy,
without asking whether they came from France or not.</P>

<P>It may be interesting to remember that the very wall-papers of the
Queen Anne and early George's time, which are now coming into fashion
again, were designed by nobody in particular, and at a time when
there were no art-schools anywhere; and one can easily see that the
wall-papers, the stuff-patterns, and the furniture of that time, all
of which things are the rage now and are turning the heads of our
fashionable seekers for novelty, <I>go together, </I>showing that
they came out of the same creative mould and were the product of a
sort of spirit-of-the-age. Now, why cannot we pursue the same course
pursued by the people of that time, refusing to copy anybody, and
trusting to artistic ideas and feeling to carry the day? Were we to
do so, we should, like enough, in the end, have France as willing to
learn of us as, in these days, she is willing to learn of that
England whom once she so much despised.</P>
