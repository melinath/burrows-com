         original papers were recently found in the attic of the
         <A HREF="../norwood/fred.html">Fred Holland Day</A> house,
         owned by the <A HREF="http://www.norwoodhistoricalsociety.org">Norwood
         Historical Society,</A> in Norwood, Massachusetts. In 1893
         Day demolished his parent's Mansard roofed Italianate house
         and, inspired by architecture seen in England, rebuilt the
         house with a brick, timber and stucco Tudor facade and an
         Arts &amp; Crafts Movement interior, dominated by a three
         story central hall overlooked with balconies and interior
         oriel windows from upper rooms. Fred's rooms were decorated
         in artistic English taste with green woodwork and
         wallpapers. His parent's rooms were outfitted with Old
         Colony Style white painted woodwork. Following the advice of
         William Morris, these rooms were decorated with wallpapers
         hung without borders and had plain painted ceilings. This
         was the cutting edge of style in New England in the late
         nineteenth century, turning away from the heavily elaborated
         decorations of the High Victorian period.</P>      </TD>

<A NAME=prior></A><A HREF="../norwood/prior.html"><IMG SRC="../images/priorysmall.gif" ALT="priory garden" WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=69 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left></A><B>"Priory
Garden</B>&quot; An English Design. This pattern pays homage to the style of William Morris, the great 
19th century English wallpaper designer. The foliage is reminiscent to &quot;Larkspur&quot; and the 
organization of the pattern, with a meander of foliage counterpointed by a grid of flowers, is like 
&quot;Marigold,&quot; but this pattern has major and minor flowers set on the diamond points of a diaper 
pattern. The document colorway has soft, tertiary hues popular in the 1880s and early 1890s, when it was 
originally produced. It draws its inspiration from Morris without copying the master's work; it is a 
sophisticated design with its own character and integrity. Priory Garden was selected by Fred Holland 
Day for his father's bedchamber in the Norwood, Massachusetts, house. 21&quot; wide with a self match 
repeat of 11 7/8&quot;. 6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. 
Documentary coloring combines tertiary hues of sage, green, ochre and blue.    
$175.00 per roll.</P>

<B>"PhillimoreWreath" </B>An English Design. In the style of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement from the 
early 1890s, this pattern adapts the common formality of large Neo-classical laurel wreaths with 
asymmetrical groupings of softly drawn leaves. Each wreath is approximately 12&quot; in diameter, and 
they are spaced in a diaper pattern at 18&quot; on center. 21&quot; wide with a self match repeat of 26 
1/2&quot;. 6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. Offered in gold on 
olive ground.

<P><B>"Chrysanthemum"</B>, an English design. A pattern from c. 1890 of lacy leaves and flowers, this 
print has a delicate figure that rests gently on the wall. In style it is like a freely organized and 
simplified version of a design of William Morris, and the original artist certainly owed much to the 
inspiration of the great English designer. 21&quot; wide with a self match repeat of 18&quot;. 6 yard 
long rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. Offered with off white figure on a 
sage-ochre ground (the document coloring) and an off white figure on a rose ground.

<B>"Peruvian Lily,"</B> an English design. The flower of this design from c. 1890 was identified by 
friend who is a horticulturist in Oakland, California. Abstracted in the manner of the finest Arts &amp; 
Crafts Movement designs, this pattern has a simplicity and elegance that is achieve with the simple use 
of color. 21&quot; wide with a self match repeat of 20 7/8&quot;. 6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square 
feet. Hand printed in New England. Offered with off white figure on a pale grey-blue ground (the 
document coloring) and an off white figure on a moss green ground. A third colorway is being 
experimented with - a warm golden yellow ground with white figures.    
$155.00 per roll.</P>

<P><B>"Kensington"</B>, an English design. Early 1890's. A striking all over figure of classic 
arabesques with palmettes, this design seems right in spirit with the paintings of Lord Leighton and 
Alma Tadema and the fashionable artistic neighborhoods of Kensington at the end of the nineteenth 
century. The near perfect symmetry (offset by one central irregular flower) has opened suggestion of 
using the print sideways as a wide frieze or dado pattern. In bold colors it is crisp and daring, and in 
muted colors it is feathery and delicate. 20 1/4&quot; wide with a self match repeat of 15 3/4&quot;. 
6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. Document coloring in brilliant 
red with white figures (we are still experimenting with this colorway), and offered in moss green with 
white figures and celadon green with putty figures.    
$165.00 per roll.</P>

<P><B>"Sandringham"</B>, an English Design. Named for the Norfolk country house of Queen Victoria, it 
possibly was originally designed for a new wing constructed in the 1880's. Documents indicate that this 
pattern was also originally made as a printed fabric. It has a large repeating figure of banded Acanthus 
leaves, conventionalized in a formal manner. It is an ideal design for a stairhall, and also is well 
suited for use in a deep band above a high wood paneled wall. 20 3/4&quot; wide with a 21&quot; self 
match. 6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. Document color in olive 
on a light olive ground. Offered in a sage green on a putty ground, and a golden yellow-ochre on an off 
white ground.    
$155.00 per roll.</P>

<P><B>"Depden"</B>, an English design. In style, this pattern could date from the late 1870's through 
the 1880's. In 1893, at the Day House in Norwood, it was used on the lower wall under a wide frieze of 
&quot;Sandringham&quot;. It is a good design for the dado (as a band of ornament at the bottom of the 
wall below the chair-rail), or wherever a small repeating figure is needed. 20 3/4&quot; wide with a 
3 1/2&quot; self match (the screen repeat is much larger). 6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square feet. 
Hand printed in New England. Documentary coloring in deep shades of olive green.

<P>"<B>Arbella</B>&quot;, an English design. This design was found in a handsome Queen Anne Revival 
house that was built in the early 1890's in Worcester, Massachusetts. It originally hung in the 
stairhall over a paneled wainscot. The figure of medallions and arabesques was inspired by 
&quot;old-fashioned&quot; patterns of the early 18th century, during the reign of Queen Anne 
(1702 - 1714), and the coloring is drawn from the mellowed colors of old English painted furniture. 
It looks very well with white painted woodwork and paneling, and also compliments the natural wood 
colors of cherry and oak, all popular finishes in the 1880's and 1890's. 20 1/2&quot; wide with a 
19&quot; self match. 6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. 
Documentary coloring with an indigo blue background and accent colors of terra cotta, green, sage and 
gold, with outlines and arabesques in off white. 
$185.00 per roll.</P>

<P><B>"Lily &amp; Rose"</B>, a Scottish design. Originally made by the firm of George Walton &amp; Co., 
and is attributed to have been drawn by Robert Graham. It is a fluid design with tendrils of lilies 
climbing in a diagonal line through a diaper pattern of conventionalized rose blossoms, thus 
incorporating the favorite flowers of the English and Scottish Arts &amp; Crafts Movements. We have 
initially developed this print as a rotary screen print and the specifications are: 28 1/2&quot; wide 
with a 12 1/2&quot; self match. 5 yard rolls, covering 30 square feet. Printed in California. A flat 
screen print of the pattern is being developed at a slightly smaller scale: 21&quot; wide with a 
11&quot; drop match. 6 yard rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. The first 
sampling is in a turquoise blue on an off white ground.

<P><B>"Rossetti",</B> by Aldam Heaton. Called the Neo-Classical Arts &amp; Crafts designer, Aldam Heaton 
practiced interior design in London and worked closely with the noted architect Richard Norman Shaw. 
This wallpaper was found in the hallway of a country house in Wellesley, Massachusetts, where it was 
originally hung in 1884. It was named by Heaton in memory of his friend, Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Two

<P><B>"Summer Street Damask",</B> attributed to John Dando Sedding. A
subtle design of figs and fig leaves in a transitional Arts &amp;
Crafts Movement and Art Nouveau pattern, it was originally made in
England. Sedding was noted as a <A HREF="http://users.bournemouth-net.co.uk/%7etomdavies">church
designer</A> who apprenticed with Street; in the 1880s his office was next door to the shop of Morris 
&amp; Co. in London. The reproduction comes from original rolls that were bought for a house in

<P><B>"Persis Wall"</B>, an English Design. An anonymous English design representative of the Aesthetic 
Movement and early Arts &amp; Crafts Movement. The figure appears as a random spray of eucalyptus leaves, 
interspersed with gilt blossoms that appear and fade across the wall. It is a particularly effective 
pattern on which to hang artwork, or in hallways and rooms with walls cut up by many doors and windows. 
The original was found in under woodwork in the old shop of Burrows &amp; Co. in Boston, and historic 
photographs show the same design in a villa near Sidney, Australia, where it had been installed around 
1880. 21&quot; wide with a drop match of 21&quot;. 6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square feet. 
6 yard long rolls, covering 30 square feet. Hand printed in New England. Offered in shades of sage

<P><B>"Persis Frieze"</B> A companion to Persis Wall, the frieze was inspired by a stencil in an early 
1880's house in California. The geometric pattern of the frieze makes a successful counterpoint with the 
random nature of the wall pattern. Frieze trims to 11&quot; high and is printed with 2 side by side on 
the roll, and it is sold by the yard. Hand printed in New England. Offered in shades of sage green, 
terra cotta, pale gold on cream, and celadon green. $35.00 per yard.</P>

paper was found, this gentle meander design looks very good with other figures beneath (Persis, Summer 
Street, Giotto or Ginko Leaf), and it is handsome above a plain painted wall. The design is c. 1880 - 90. 
It is 17 1/2&quot; tall, which neatly fits over the picture rail in many American Victorian houses.
