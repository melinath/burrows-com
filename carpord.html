<P>Burrows &amp; Co. will be happy to supply an estimate for your
particular project if you can supply the measurement for the room or
area rug. The more precise measurements you can provide will assist
in the accuracy of the cost estimate. Plans can be forwarded to
qualified installers around the country who will quote installation
or fabrication costs. Be sure to let me known what city or state your
reside in, so we can make inquiries to the closest installer and
include the relevant inland freight costs in the estimate.</P>

<P>We require a 2/3 deposit for the cost of the material, with the
final 1/3 payment when the shipment arrives from England and prior to
the installation or fabrication. The final installation charges are
due upon completion or delivery, or paid to the installer if it is
invoiced directly.</P>

<P>If you have engaged the services of an established interior
designer or a licensed architect, please let me know from the outset
of our discussions. Price considerations are offered to trade
professionals with recognized credentials for their service in
overseeing measurements, handling ordering details and overseeing the
installation.</P>

<P>In several areas of the United States we refer inquiries to trade
showrooms, or retail distributors. Please refer to <A HREF="business.html">Doing
Business With Us.</A> In other parts of the world we can refer you to
local sales agents for the Stourvale Mill Collection.</P>
