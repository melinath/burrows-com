<HR>

Lastly, love of nature in all its forms must be the ruling spirit of
such works of art as we are considering; the brain that guides the
hand must be healthy and hopeful, must be keenly alive to the
surroundings of our own days, and must be only so much affected by
the art of past times as it is natural for one who practices an art
which is alive, growing, and looking toward the future.</P>

<P>Asking you to keep these principles in mind, I will now, with your
leave, pass briefly over the Lesser Arts with which I myself am
conversant.</P>

<P>Yet, first, I must mention an art which, though it ministers to
our material needs, and therefore, according to what I have said as
to the division between purely spiritual and partly material arts,
should be reckoned among the Lesser Arts, has, to judge by its
etymology, not been so reckoned in times past, for it has been called
Architecture; nevertheless, it does practically come under the
condemnation of those who despise the lesser or more material arts;
so please allow me to reckon it among them.</P>

<P>Now, speaking of the whole world and at all times, it would not be
quite correct to say that the other arts could not exist without it;
because there both have been, and are large and important races of
mankind who, properly speaking, have no architecture, who are not
house-dwellers but tent-dwellers, and who, nevertheless, are by no
means barren of the arts.</P>

<P>For all that it is true that these non-architectural races (let
the Chinese stand as a type of them) have no general mastery over the
arts, and seem to play with them rather than to try to put their
souls into them. Clumsy-handed as the European or Aryan workman is
(of a good period, I mean) as compared with his Turanian fellow,
there is a seriousness and meaning about his work that raises it as a
piece of art far above the deftness of China and Japan; and it is
this very seriousness and depth of feeling which, when brought to
bear upon the matters of our daily life, is in fact the soul of
Architecture, whatever the body may be; so that I shall still say
that among ourselves, the men of modern Europe, the existence of the
other arts is bound up with that of Architecture. Please do not
forget that, whatever else I may say to-day, you must suppose me to
assume that we have noble buildings which we have to adorn with our
lesser arts: for this art of building is the true democratic art, the
child of the man-inhabited earth, the expression of the life of man
thereon. I claim for our Society no less a position than this, than
in calling on you to reverence the examples of noble building, and to
understand and protect the continuity of its history, it is guarding
the very springs of all art, of all cultivation.</P>

<P>Now I would not do this noble art such disrespect as to speak of
it in detail as only a part of a subject. I would not treat it so
even in its narrower sense as the art of building; its wider sense I
consider to mean the art of creating a building with all the
appliances fit for carrying on a dignified and happy life. The arts I
have to speak of in more detail are a part, and comparatively a small
part, of Architecture considered in that light; but there is so much
to be said even about these, when we have once made up our mind that
they are worth our attention at all, that you must understand that my
talk to-night will simply be hints to draw your attention to the
subjects in question.</P>

<P>I shall try, then, to give you some hints on these arts or
crafts--pottery and glass-making; weaving, with its necessary servant
dyeing; the craft of printing patterns <I>(a)</I> on cloth,
<I>(b)</I> on paper; furniture; and also, with fear and trembling, I
will say a word on the art of dress. Some of these are lesser arts
with a vengeance; only you see I happen to know something about them
practically, and so venture to speak of them.</P>

<P>So let us begin with pottery, the most ancient and universal, as
it is perhaps (setting aside house-building the most important of the
lesser arts, and one, too, the consideration of which recommends
itself to us from a more or less historical point of view, because,
owing to the indestructibility of its surface, it is one of the few
domestic arts of which any specimens are left to us of the ancient
and classical times.</P>

<P>Now all nations, however barbarous, have made pottery, sometimes
of shapes obviously graceful, sometimes with a mingling of wild
grotesquery amid gracefulness; but none have ever failed to make it
on true principles, none have made shapes ugly or base till quite
modern times. I should say that the making of ugly pottery was one of
the most remarkable inventions of our civilisation.</P>

<P>All nations with any turn for art have speedily discovered what
capabilities for producing beautiful form lie in the making of an
earthen pot of the commonest kind, and what opportunities it offers
for the reception of swift and unlaborious, but rich ornament; and
how nothing hinders that ornament from taking the form of
representation of history and legend. In favour of this art the
classical nations relaxed the artistic severity that insisted
otherwhere on perfection of Figure-drawing in architectural work; and
we may partly guess what an astonishing number there must have been
of capable and ready draughtsmen in the good times of Greek Art from
the great mass of first rate painting on pottery, garnered from the
tombs mostly, and still preserved in our museums after all these
centuries of violence and neglect.</P>

<P>Side by side with the scientific and accomplished work of the
Greeks, and begun much earlier than the earliest of it, was being
practiced another form of the art in Egypt and the Euphrates valley;
it was less perfect in the highest qualities of design, but was more
elaborate in technique, which elaboration no doubt was forced into
existence by a craving for variety and depth of colour and richness
of decoration, which did not press heavily on the peoples of the
classical civilisation, who, masters of form as they were, troubled
themselves but little about the refinements of colour. This art has
another interest for us in the fact that from it sprang up all the
great school of pottery which has flourished in the East, apart from
the special and peculiar work of China.</P>

<P>Though the fictile art of that country is a development of so much
later date than what we have just been considering, let us make a
note of it here as the third kind of potter's work, which no doubt
had its origin in the exploitation of local material joined to the
peculiar turn of the Chinese workman for <I>finesse</I> of manual
skill and for boundless patience.</P>

<P>Northern Europe during the Middle Ages, including our own country,
could no more do without a native art of pottery than any other
simple peoples; but the work done by them being very rough, and
serving for the commonest domestic purposes (always with the
exception of certain tile-work), had-not the chance of preservation
which superstition gave to the Greek pottery, and very little of it
is left; that little shows us that our Gothic forefathers shared the
pleasure in the potter's wheel and the capabilities of clay for
quaint and pleasant form and fanciful invention which has been common
to most times and places, and this rough craft even lived on as a
village art till almost the days of our grandfathers, turning out
worthy work enough, done in a very unconscious and simple fashion on
the old and true principles of art, side by side with the whims and
inanities which mere fashion had imposed on so-called educated
people.</P>

<P>Every one of these forms of art, with many another which I have no
time to speak of, was good in itself; the general principles of them
may be expressed somewhat as follows:--</P>

<P>1. Your vessel must be of a convenient shape for its purpose.</P>

<P>2. Its shape must show to the greatest advantage the plastic and
easily-worked nature of clay; the lines of its contour must flow
easily; but you must be on the look-out to check the weakness and
languidness that comes from striving after over-elegance.</P>

<P>3. All the surface must show the hand of the potter, and not be
finished with a baser tool.</P>

<P>4. Smoothness and high finish of surface, though a quality not to
be despised, is to be sought after as a means for gaining some
special elegance of ornament, and not as an end for its own sake.</P>

<P>5. The commoner the material the rougher the ornament, but by no
means the scantier; on the contrary, a pot of fine materials may be
more slightly ornamented, both because all the parts of the
ornamentation will be minuter, and also because it will in general be
considered more carefully.</P>

<P>6. As in the making of the pot, so in its surface ornament, the
hand of the workman must be always visible in it; it must glorify the
necessary tools and necessary pigment: swift and decided execution is
necessary to it; whatever delicacy there may be in it must be won in
the teeth of the difficulties that will result from this; and because
of these difficulties the delicacy will be more exquisite and
delightful than in easier arts where, so to say, the execution can
wait for more laborious patience.</P>

<P>These, I say, seem to me the principles that guided the potter's
art in the days when it was progressive: it began to cease to be so
in civilised countries somewhat late in that period of blight which
was introduced by the so called Renaissance. Excuse a word or two
more of well-known history in explanation.</P>

<P>Our own pottery of Northern Europe, made doubtless without any
reference to classical models, was very rude, as I have said; it was
fashioned of natural clay, glazed when necessary transparently with
salt or lead, and the ornament on it was done with another
light-coloured clay, sometimes coloured further with metallic oxides
under the glaze. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
more finished work, which had its origin, as before mentioned, in
Egypt and the Euphrates valley, was introduced into Southern Europe
through Moorish or rather Arab Spain, and other points of contact
between Europe and the East. This ware, known now as Majolica, was of
an earthen body covered with opaque white glaze, ornamented with
colours formed of oxides, some of which were by a curious process
reduced into a metallic state, giving thereby strange and beautiful
lustrous colours.</P>
