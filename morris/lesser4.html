So much, and very briefly, of these two important Lesser Arts, which
it must be admitted are useful, even to Diogenes, since the
introduction of tea: I have myself at a pinch tried a tin mug for
tea, and found it altogether inconvenient, and a horn I found worse
still; so, since we must have pottery and glass, and since it is only
by an exertion of the cultivated intellect that they can be made
ugly, I must needs wish that we might take a little less trouble in
that direction: at the same- time I quite understand that in this
case both the goods would cost the consumes more, even much more, and
that the capitalists who risk their money in keeping the
manufactories of the goods going would make less money; both which
things to my mind would be fruitful in benefits to the community.</P>

<P>The next craft I have to speak of is that of Weaving: not so much
of an art as pottery and glass-making, because so much of it must be
mechanical, engaged in the making of mere plain cloth; of which side
of it all one need say is that we should have as little plain cloth
made as we conveniently can, and for that reason should insist on
having it made well and solidly, and of good materials; the other
side of it, that which deals with figure - weaving, must be
subdivided into figure-weaving which is carried out mechanically, and
figure-weaving which is altogether a handicraft.</P>

<P>As to the first of these, its interest is limited by the fact that
it is mechanical; since the manner of doing it has with some few
exceptions varied little for many hundred years: such trivial
alterations as the lifting the warp-threads by means of the Jacquard
machine, or throwing the shuttle by steam-power, ought not to make
much difference in the art of it, though I cannot say that they have
not done so. On the other hand, though mechanical, it produces very
beautiful things, which an artist cannot disregard, and man's
ingenuity and love of beauty may be made obvious enough in it;
neither do I call the figure weaver's craft a dull one, if he be set
to do things which are worth doing: to watch the web growing day by
day almost magically, in anticipation of the time when it is to be
taken out and one can see it on the right side in all its well
schemed beauty; to make something beautiful that will last, out of a
few threads of silk and wool, seems to me not an unpleasant way of
earning one's livelihood, so long only as one lives and works in a
pleasant place, with work-day not too long, and a book or two to be
got at.</P>

<P>However, since this is admittedly a mechanical craft, I have not
much to say of it, since it is not my business this evening to speak
of the designs for its fashioning: this much one may say, that as the
designing of woven stuffs fell into degradation in the latter days,
the designers got fidgeting after trivial novelties; change for the
sake of change; they must needs strive to make their woven flowers
look as if they were painted with a brush, or even sometimes as if
they were drawn by the engraver's burin. This gave them plenty of
trouble and exercised their ingenuity in the tormenting of their web
with spots and stripes and ribs and the rest of it, but quite
destroyed the seriousness of the work, and even its <I>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</I> . As of pottery-painting, so of figure weaving: do
nothing in it but that which only weaving can do: and to this end
make your design as elaborate as you please in silhouette, but carry
it out simply; you are not drawing lines freely with your shuttle,
you are building up a pattern with a fine rectilinear mosaic. If this
is kept well in mind by the designer, and he does not try to force
his material into no-thoroughfares, he may have abundant pleasure in
the making of woven stuffs, and he is perhaps less likely to go wrong
(ii he has a feeling for colour) in this err than in any other. I
will say further that he should be careful to get due proportions
between his warp and weft: not to starve the first, which is the body
of the web so to say, for the sake of the second, which is its
clothes: this is done now-a-days over much by ingenious designers who
are trying to make their web look like non-mechanical stuffs, or who
want to get a delusive show of solidity in a poor cloth, which is
much to be avoided: a similar fault we are too likely to fall into is
of a piece with what is done in all the lesser arts to-day; and which
doubtless is much fostered by the ease given to our managers of works
by the over-development of machinery: I am thinking of the weaving up
of rubbish into apparently delicate and dainty wares. No man, with
the true instinct of a workman, should have anything to do with this:
it may not mean commercial dishonesty, though I suspect it sometimes
does, but it must mean artistic dishonesty: poor materials in this
craft, as in all others, should only be used in coarse work, where
they are used without presence for what they are: this we must agree
to at once, or sink all art in commerce (so-called) in these
crafts.</P>

<P>So much for mechanical figure-weaving. Its <I>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</I> is that it gives scope to the application of
imagination and beauty to any cloth, thick or thin, close or open,
costly or cheap; in some way or other you may weave any of these into
figures; but when we may limit ourselves to certain heavy, close, and
very costly cloths we no longer need the help of anything that can
fairly be called machine: little more is needed than a frame which
will support heavy beams on which we may strain our warp: our work is
purely hand-work--we may do what we will according to the fineness of
our warp: these are the conditions of carpet and tapestry weaving:
meaning by carpets the real thing, such as the East has furnished us
with from time immemorial, and not the makeshift imitation woven by
means of the Jacquard loom, or otherwise mechanically.</P>

<P>As to the art of carpet-weaving, then, one must say that
historically it belongs to the East. I do not think it has been
proved that any piled carpets were made in Europe during the Middle
Ages proper, though some writers have thought that a fabric called in
edicts of the fourteenth century "tapisserie sarracenois," was in
fact piled carpet-work: however in the seventeenth century they
certainly were being made to a certain extent even in these islands:
amongst other examples I have seen some pieces of carpet-work in a
Jacobean house in 0xfordshire, which an inventory of about 162O calls
oddly enough "Irish stitch:" but wherever the history of the art may
begin among ourselves, I fear it may almost be said to end with the
seventeenth century; there are still a few places where hand-wrought
carpets, are made, but scarcely anything original is done; coarsely
copied imitations, of the Levantine carpets, and a sort of deduction
from the degraded follies of the time of Louis XV., traditionally
thought to be suitable for the dreary waste of an aristocratic
country-horse, are nearly all that is turned out at present. Still I
do not agree with an opinion, which I have heard expressed, that
carpets can only be made in the East: such carpets as have been made
there for the last hundred years or so, which are chiefly pieces of
nearly formless colour, could not be made satisfactorily and
spontaneously by Western art; but these carpets, delightful as they
are, are themselves the product of a failing art: their prototypes
are partly those simple but scientifically designed cloths, whose
patterns are founded on the elaborate pavement mosaics of Byzantine
art; and partly they are degradations, traceable by close study, from
the elaborate floral art of Persia; the originals of the first kind
may be seen accurately figured in many of the pictures of the palmy
days of Italian and Flemish art, and, as I have said, they are
designed on scientific principles which any good designer can apply
to works of our own day without burdening his conscience with the
charge of plagiarism. As to the other kind of the Persian floral
designs, there are still a few of these in existence though, as I
have never seen any of them figured in old pictures, I doubt if they
found their way to Europe much in the Middle Ages. These, beautiful
as they are in colour, are as far as possible from lacking form in
design; they are fertile of imagination and lovely in drawing; and
though imitation of them would carry with it its usual disastrous
consequences, they show us the way to set about designing suchlike
things, and that a carpet can be made which by no means depends for
its success on the mere instinct for colour, which is the last gift
of art to leave certain races. Withal, one thing seems certain, that
if we don't set to work making our own carpets it will not be long
before we shall find the East fail us: for that last gift, the gift
of the sense of harmonious colour, is speedily dying out in the East
before the conquests of European rises and money-bags.</P>
