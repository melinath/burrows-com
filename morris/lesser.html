<FONT SIZE="+1">T</FONT>HE Lesser Arts of Life may not seem to some
of you worth considering, even for an hour. In these brisk days of
the world, amidst this high civilisation of ours, we are too eager
and busy, it may be said, to take note of any form of art that does
not either stir our emotions deeply, or strain the attention of the
most intellectual part of our minds.</P>

<P>Now for this rejection of the lesser arts there may be something
to be said, supposing it be done in a certain way and with certain
ends in view; nevertheless it seems to me that the lesser arts, when
they are rejected, are so treated for no sufficient reason, and to
the injury of the community; therefore I feel no shame in standing
before you as a professed pleader and advocate for them, as indeed I
well may, since it is through them that I am the servant of the
public, and earn my living with abundant pleasure.</P>

<P>Then comes the question, What are to be considered the Lesser Arts
of Life? I suppose there might be pros and cons argued on that
question, but I doubt if the argument would be worth the time and
trouble it would cost; nevertheless, I want you to agree with me in
thinking that these lesser arts are really a part of the greater ones
which only a man or two here and there (among cultivated people) will
venture to acknowledge that he contemns, whatever the real state of
the case may be on that matter. The Greater Arts of Life, what are
<I>they </I>? Since people may use the word in very different senses,
I will say, without pretending to give a definition, that what I mean
by an art is some creation of man which appeals to his emotions and
his intellect by means of his senses. All the greater arts appeal
directly to that intricate combination of intuitive perceptions,
feelings, experience, and memory which is called imagination. All
artists, who deal with those arts, have these qualities
superabundantly, and have them balanced in such exquisite order that
they can use them for purposes of creation. But we must never forget
that all men-who are not naturally deficient, or who have not been
spoiled by defective or perverse education, have imagination in some
measure, and also have some of the order which guides it; so that
they also are partakers of the greater arts, and the masters of them
have not to speak under their breath to half-a-dozen chosen men, but
rather their due audience is the whole race of man properly and
healthily developed. But as you know, the race of man, even when very
moderately civilised, has a great number of wants which have to be
satisfied by the organised labour of the community. From father to
son, from generation to generation, has grown up a body of almost
mysterious skill, which has exercised itself in making the tools for
carrying on the occupation of living; so that a very large part of
the audience of the masters of the greater arts have been engaged
like them in making things; only the higher men were making things
wholly to satisfy men's spiritual wants; the lower, things whose
first intention was to satisfy their bodily wants. But though, in
theory, all these could be satisfied without any expression of the
imagination, any practice of art, yet history tells us what we might
well have guessed would be the case, that the thing could not stop
there. Men whose hands were skilled in fashioning things could not
help thinking the while, and soon found out that their deft fingers
could express some part of the tangle of their thoughts, and that
this new pleasure hindered not their daily work, for in their very
labour that they lived by lay the material in which their thought
could be embodied; and thus though they laboured, they laboured
somewhat for their pleasure and uncompelled, and had conquered the
curse of toil, and were men.</P>

<P>Here, then, we have two kinds of art: one of them would exist even
if men had no needs but such as are essentially spiritual, and only
accidentally material or bodily. The other kind, called into
existence by material needs is bound no less to recognise the
aspirations of the soul, and receives the impress of its striving
towards perfection.</P>

<P>If the case be as I have represented it, even the lesser arts are
well worthy the attention of reasonable men, and those who despise
them must do so either out of ignorance as to what they really are,
or because they themselves are in some way or other enemies of
civilisation, either outlaws from it or corrupters of it.</P>

<P>As to the outlaws from civilisation, they are those of whom I
began by saying that there are or were people who rejected the arts
of life on grounds that we could at least understand, if we could not
sympathise with the rejecters. There have been in all ages of
civilisation men who have acted, or had a tendency to act, on some
such principle as the following words represent:-The world is full of
grievous labour, the poor toiling for the rich, and ever remaining
poor; with this we, at least, will have nought to do; we cannot amend
it, but we will not be enriched by it, nor be any better than the
worst of our fellows.</P>

<P>Well, this is what may be called the monk's way of rejecting the
arts, whether he be Christian monk, or Buddhist ascetic, or ancient
philosopher. I believe he is wrong, but I cannot call him enemy.
Sometimes I can't help thinking, Who knows but what the whole world
may come to that for a little? the field of art may have to lie
fallow a while that the weeds may be known for what they are, and be
burnt in the end.</P>

<P>I say that I have at least respect for the dwellers in the tub of
Diogenes; indeed I don't look upon it as so bad a house after ale
With a plane-tree and a clear brook near it, and some chance of daily
bread and onions, it will do well enough. I have seen worse houses to
let for &#163;700 a year. But, mind you, it must be the real thing.
The tub of Diogenes lined with padded drab velvet, lighted by gas,
polished and cleaned by vicarious labour, and expecting every morning
due visits from the milkman, the baker, the butcher, and the
fishmonger, that is a cynical dwelling which I cannot praise. If we
are to be excused for rejecting the arts, it must be not because we
are contented to be less than men, but because we long to be more
than men.</P>

<P>For I have said that there are some rejecters of the arts who are
corrupters of civilisation. Indeed, they do not altogether reject
them; they will eat them and drink them and wear them, and use them
as lackeys to eke out their grandeur, and as nets to catch money
with, but nothing will they learn or care about them. They will push
them to the utmost as far as the satisfying of their material needs
go, they will increase the labour infinitely that produces material
comfort, but they will reach no helping hand to that which makes
labour tolerable; and they themselves are but a part of the crowd
that toils without an aim; for they themselves labour with tireless
energy to multiply the race of man, and then make the multitude
unhappy. Therefore let us pity them, that they have been born coarse,
violent, unjust, inhuman;--let us pity them, yet resist them.</P>

<P>For these things they do unwitting indeed, but are none the less
oppressors--oppressors of the arts, and therefore of the people, who
have a right to the solace which the arts alone can give to the life
of simple men. Well, these men are, singly or in combination, the
rich and powerful of the world; they rule civilisation at present,
and if it were not through ignorance that they err, those who see the
fault and lament it would indeed have no choice but to reject all
civilisation with the ascetic; but since they are led astray
unwittingly, there is belike a better way to resist their oppression
than by mere renunciation. I say that if there were no other way of
resisting those oppressors of the people - whom we call in modern
slang "Philistines "--save the monk's or ascetic's way, that is the
way all honest men would have to take, whose eyes were opened to the
evil. But there is another way of resistance, which I shall ask your
leave to call the citizen's way, who says: There is a vast deal of
labour spent in supplying civilised man with things which he has come
to consider needful, and which, as a rule, he will not do without.
Much of that labour is grievous and oppressive; but since there is
much more of grievous labour in the world than there used to be, it
is clear that there is more than there need be, and more than there
will be in time to come, if only men of goodwill look to it; what
therefore can we do towards furthering that good time and reducing
the amount of grievous labour; first) by abstaining from multiplying
our material wants unnecessarily; and secondly, by doing our best to
introduce the elements of hope and pleasure into all the labour with
which we have anything to do?</P>

<P>These, I think, are the principles on which the citizen's
resistance to Philistine oppression must be founded; to do with as
few things as we can, and, as far as we can, to see to it that these
things are the work of freemen and not of slaves; these two seem to
me to be the main duties to be fulfilled by those who wish to live a
life at once free and refined, serviceable to others, and pleasant to
themselves.</P>

<P>Now it is clear that if we are to fulfil these duties we must take
active interest in the arts of life which supply men's material
needs, and know something about them, so that we may be able to
distinguish slaves' work from freemen's, and to decide what we may
accept and what we must renounce of the wares that are offered to us
as necessaries and comforts of life. It is to help you to a small
fragment of this necessary knowledge that I am standing before you
with this word in my mouth, the Lesser Arts of Life. Of course it is
only on a few of these that I have anything to say to you, but of
those that I shall speak I believe I know something either as a
workman or a very deeply interested onlooker; wherefore I shall ask
your leave to speak quite plainly and without fear or favour.</P>

<P>You understand that our ground is, that not only is it possible to
make the matters needful to our daily life works of art, but that
there is something wrong in the civilisation that does not do this:
if our houses, our clothes, our household furniture and utensils are
not works of art, they are either wretched make-shifts, or what is
worse, degrading shams of better things.</P>

<P>Furthermore, if any of these things make any claim to be
considered works of art, they must show obvious traces of the hand of
man guided directly by his brain, without more interposition of
machines than is absolutely necessary to the nature of the work
done.</P>

<P>Again, whatsoever art there is in any of these articles of daily
use must be evolved in a natural and unforced manner from the
material that is dealt with: so that the result will be such as could
not be got from any other material: if we break this law we shall
make a triviality, a toy, not a work of art.</P>
