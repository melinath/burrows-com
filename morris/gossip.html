Village of Kelmscott lies close to the Thames on the Oxfordshire side
of it, some five miles (by water) from the present end of the
navigation at Inglesham, where the Colne, coming down from Fairford,
Bibury and Chedworth, joins the main stream of the Thames.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/garden.gif" ALT="Manor House at Kelmscott" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=357 ALIGN=right></P>

<P>Kelmscott lies on the plain of the Thames Valley, but the ground
rises up from it gradually, with little interruption of the rise,
till the crest of the ridge is gained which lies between Oxfordshire
and Worcestershire, culminating in the Broadway Beacon some thirty
miles from Kelmscott. To the N.E. of the village lies the nearly
treeless piece of ground formerly Grafton Common, and beyond it is a
string of pretty inland villages, or rather two strings, the westward
comprising little Faringdon, Broughton Poggs and Filkins; the
eastward, Langford, Broadwell, and Kencott. Of these Langford with
its church partly 13th century, partly preconquest, Broadwell with
its lovely 13th century tower and spire, and the curious little
church of Broughton Poggs are specially interesting.</P>

<P>Turning south from Kelmscott one comes on the Thames, with the
weir of Eaton Hastings on the foot-path from the village, but on the
Berkshire side a range of heights low, but well designed, rise up
from the flat meadows here, and running eastward well into a higher
range on which Faringdon lies. Three miles down the river is a very
pretty 15th century bridge of three arches which carries the road
from Bampton to Faringdon over the Thames at Radcot. On the Eyott and
the fields about here was fought a battle between the Earl of Oxford,
Richard II supporter, and Bolingbroke, as the latter marched toward
his thrown; and Cromwell also fought a skirmish there on his advance
to the attack of Faringdon House, which was one of the stubbornest of
the scattered Royalist strongholds.</P>

<P>To get back to Kelmscott again. The church, at the N.W. end of the
village, is small but interesting; the mass of it, a nave with a tiny
aisle transept and chancel, being Early English of date, though the
arches of the aisle are round-headed; a feature which is imitated
from Faringdon Church, and repeated at Little Faringdon, and
Langford. There are remains of painting all over the church, the N.
transept having been painted with figure subjects of the life of
Christ in trefoil head panels. The E. window has a painted glass
image of St. George (in whose honour the church is dedicated) of the
time of Edward IVth. Most of the windows (which are insertions of the
early 14th century) have their inner arches elegantly cusped, a
characteristic feature of these Oxfordshire churches. A very
beautiful pell-cot formed by two trefoil arches crowns the eastern
gable of the nave, and composes pleasantly with the low pitched roofs
over a clerestory, which in the 15th century took the place of the
once high-pitched ones. The church is plastered almost all over the
walls, as no doubt it was in the earliest days: it is fortunate in
having escaped the process of stripping and pointing which so many of
our village churches have undergone at the hands of the restoring
wise-acres.</P>

you turn down from the church toward the Thames you come at a corner
of the road on the base of the village cross probably of the 15th
century), and then, turning to the left and bearing round to the
right, all of which transaction takes place in about two hundred
yards, you come face to face with a mass of grey walls and pearly
grey roofs which makes the House, called by courtesy the Manor House,
though it seems to have no manorial rights attached to it, which is
the ultimate subject of this paper, and which I have held for
twenty-three years. It lies at the very end of the village on a road
which, brought up shortly by a back-water of the Thames, becomes a
mere cart track leading into the meadows along the river.</P>

<P>You enter through a door in a high impointed stone wall, having
passed by first a pretty, characteristic cottage with its baking oven
much <I>en evidence</I>, and next a shed with high-pitched-roof.
Entering the door in the wall you go up a flagged path through the
front garden to the porch, which is a modern but harmless addition in
wood. The house from this side is a lowish three storied one with
mullioned windows, (in the 3rd these are in the gables) and at right
angles to this another block whose bigger lower windows and
pedimented gable lights indicate a later date. The house is built of
well-laid rubble stone of the district, the wall of the latter part
being buttered over, so to say, with thin plaster which has now
weathered to the same colour as the stone of the walls; the roofs are
covered with the beautiful stone slates of the district, the most
lovely covering which a roof can have, especially when, as here and
in all the traditional old houses of the countryside, they are `sized
down'; the smaller ones to the top and the bigger toward the eaves,
which gives one of the same sort of pleasure in their orderly beauty
as a fishers' scales or a birds' feathers.</P>

<P>Turning round the house by the bigger block, one sees where the
gable of the older and simpler part of the house once came out, and
notes with pleasure the simple expression of the difference of levels
in the 1st floor and 3rd floor, as by the diversity of windows and
roofs: the back of the house shows nothing but the work of the
earlier builders, and is in plan of the shape of an E with the tongue
cut out, &#91; of the older part of the house, is copied in the later
addition, and the two with their elegantly shaped gables, handsomely
moulded, add much to the general beauty of the house.</P>

<P>Standing a little aloof from the N.E. angle of the building one
can get the best idea of a fact which it is essential to note, and
which is found in all these old homes here-abouts, to wit, all the
walls `batter,' i.e. lean a little back. this is so invariable that
it is hardly possible to suppose that it is an example of traditional
design from which the builders could not escape. To my mind it is a
beauty, taking from the building a rigidity which would otherwise mar
it; giving it (I can think of no other word) a flexibility which is
never found in our modern imitations of the houses of this age.</P>

<P>From this square place also one gets a good view of the farm
buildings which stand to the South of the house; a very handsome barn
of quite beautiful proportions, and several other sheds, including a
good dove cot, all built in the same way as the house, and grouping
delightfully with it.</P>

garden, divided by old clipped yew hedges, is quite unaffected and
very pleasant, and looks in fact as if it were a part of the house,
yet at least the clothes of it: which I think ought to be the aim of
the layer out of a garden. Many a good house both old and new is
marred by the vulgarity and stupidity of its garden, so that one is
tormented by having to abstract in one's mind the good building from
the nightmare of `horticulture' which surrounds it.</P>

<P>Going under an arched opening in the yew hedge which makes a
little garth about a low door in the middle of the north wall, one
comes into a curious passage or lobby, a part of which is screened
into a kind of pantry by wooden mullions which have once been glazed,
and offer somewhat of a problem to the architect. The said lobby
leads into what was once a great parlour (the house is not great at
all remember) and is now panelled with pleasing George Ist panelling
painted white: the chimney piece is no doubt of the date of the
building, and is of rude but rather amusing country work; the windows
in this room are large and transomed, and it as pleasant as possible;
and I have many a memory of hot summer mornings passed in its
coolness amidst the green reflections of the garden. Turning back,
and following a little passage leading from the lobby aforesaid to
the earlier part of the house, one passes by a room in the long arm
of the &#91; almost level with the garden, with a stone chimney-piece
rude enough as to its carving but well designed: and then at the end
of the little passage is a delightful little room quite low
ceilinged, in the place where the house is `thin in the wind,' so
that there is a window east and a window west, and the whole room has
a good deal the look of a particularly pleasant cabin at sea, were it
not for the elms and the rooks on the west, and the green garden
shrugs and the blackbirds on the east. This room is really the heart
of the Kelmscott house, having been the parlor of the old house
before `Mr. Thomas Turner built the house in the closes and on the
tofts where once stood two ancient houses,' as an old deed has it;
one of the `ancient houses,' as I am clear, being the old part of the
present house, and Mr. Thomas Turner only built the grander and high
block or wing.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/library.gif" ALT="Parlor at Kelmscott" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=382 ALIGN=right></P>

<P>Outside this little parlour is the entrance passage from the
flagged path aforesaid, made by two stout studded partitions the
carpentry of which is very agreable to anyone who does not want
cabinet work to supplant carpentry. The very pleasant kitchen is on
the further side of this entrance. Going back to the little passage
which leads to the lobby one comes to the staircaise, of a common
Elizabethan pattern with spherical knops on the standards, and so on
to the first floor which has the peculiarity of being without
passages, so that you have to go from one room into another, to the
confusion of some of our casual visitors, to whom a bed in the close
neighbourhood of a sitting room is a dire impropriety. Braving this
terror, we must pass through the only north room in the house, which
is in the junction of the older and the newer house and up three
steps into the Tapestry, which is over the big panelled parlour. The
walls of it are hung with tapestry of about 1600, representing the
story of Samson; they were never great works of art, and now when all
the bright colours are faded out, and nothing is left but the indigo
blues, the greys and the warm yellowy browns, they look better, I
think, than they were meant to look: at any rate they make the walls
a very pleasant background for the living people who haunt the room;
(it is our best sitting room now, though it was once the best
bed-room) and, in spite of the designer, they give an air of romance
to the room which nothing else would quite do.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/a.gif" ALT="A" WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=56 ALIGN=left>NOTHER
charm this room has, that through its south window you not only catch
a glimpse of the Thames clover meadows and the pretty little
elm-crowned hill over in Berkshire, but if you sit in the proper
place, you can see not only the barn aforesaid with its beautiful
sharp gable, the grey stone sheds, and the dove cot, but also the
flank of the earlier house and its little gables and grey-scaled
roofs, and this is a beautiful outlook indeed. Mr. New will, I am
sure, give you a good idea of this - at least as much of it as the
limits of his drawing will admit. The chimney-piece of this room is
of stone, and of the date of the later work; again it is good after
its rough country fashion; and in the middle of it, surrounded by a
mantling by no means in-elegant, is the coat-armour of the Turners,
argent, a cross ermine, four mill-rhinds sable. A mill-rhind by the
way is that thing in which the spindle <I>turns</I>: hence the
charge, which makes a piece of `canting heraldry,' as `tis called in
French, <I>armes parlantes</I>.</P>

<P>Out of this best room let us pass through our present best bed
room over the little parlour, and leaving a very pleasant room on the
right, called the cheese-room when I first came to the house, and on
the left a little room partitioned in modern times from a lobby, and
which has the distinction of having its glazing almost wholly of old
quarries - leaving all this we come to a newel stair-case, which
comes up from the kitchen, and leads us up in the attics, i.e. the
open roof under the slates, a very sturdy collar beam roof of elm
often unsquared; it is most curiously divided under most of the
smaller gables into little chambers where no doubt people, perhaps
the hired field labourers, slept in old time: the bigger space is
open, and is a fine place for children to play in, and has charming
views east, west and north: but much of it is too curious for
description. On one of the mullions of the older house is scored T W
K 1577 Oct. 16. I believe this to be genuine, and not a relation to
`Bill Stumps his mark.' K is like enough to be Kinch, a name still
common hereabout. Again on a gable of the latter part is scored T B
1640 and representation in the manner of youth of either T.B., or his
father, or schoolmaster; I am inclined to think the latter. T.B. I
take to be one of the Bradshaws, several generations of whom are
buried in Kelmscott church. These dates certainly square with
probabilities, as the older part of the house <I>looks</I> about
1573, and the later (in this country side) <I>looks </I>1630 to 1640.
One thing I should have said before as to the position of the House:
we are on the very confines of Oxfordshire; a slow brook or ditch
saunters off to the Thames somewhat less than a furlong west from us,
which is called the Town Ditch, or the County Ditch, and on the other
side thereof is Gloucestershire.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/H.gif" ALT="H" WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=56 ALIGN=left>ERE
then are a few words about a house that I love; with a reasonable
love I think: for though my words may give you no idea of any special
charm about it, yet I assure you that the charm is there; so much has
the old house grown up out of the soil and the lives of those that
lived on it; needing no grand office-architect, with no great longing
for anything else than correctness, and to be like Julius Caesar; but
some thin thread of tradition, a half-anxious sense of the delight of
the meadow and acre and wood and river; a certain amount (not too
much let us hope) of common sense, a liking for making materials
serve ones turn, and perhaps at bottom some little grain of
sentiment. This I think was what went to the making of the old house;
might we not manage to find some sympathy for all that from
henceforward; or must we but shrink before the Philistine with one,
Alas that it must perish!</P>
