<HR>

This art quickly spread through Italy, and for a short time was
practiced there with very great success, but was not much taken up by
the nations of Northern Europe, who for the most part went on making
the old lead or salt glazed earthenware; the latter, known as
Gr&eacute;s de Cologne, still exists as a rough manufacture in the
border lands of France and Germany, though I should think it is not
destined to live much longer otherwise than as a galvanised modern
antique.</P>

<P>When Italy was still turning out fine works in the Majolica wares
much of the glory of the Renaissance was yet shining; but the last
flicker of that glory had died out by the time that another form of
Eastern art invaded our European pottery. Doubtless the folly of the
time would have found another instrument for destroying whatever of
genuine art was left among our potters if it had not had the work of
China ready to hand, but it came to pass that this was the instrument
that finally made nonsense of the whole craft among us. True it is
that a very great proportion of the Chinese work imported consisted
of genuine works of art of their kind, though mostly much inferior to
the work of Persia, Damascus, or Granada; but the fact is it was not
the art in it that captivated our forefathers, but its grosser and
more material qualities--the whiteness of the paste, the hardness of
the glaze, the neatness of the painting, and the consequent delicacy,
or luxuriousness rather, of the ware, were the qualities that the
eighteenth century potters strove so hard to imitate. They were
indeed valuable qualities in the hands of a Chinaman, deft as he was
of execution, fertile of design, fanciful though not imaginative; in
short, a born maker of pretty toys; but such daintinesses were of
little avail to a good workman of our race, cager, impatient,
imaginative, with something of melancholy or moroseness even in his
sport, his very jokes two-edged and fierce, he had other work to do,
if his employers but knew it, than the making of toys.</P>

<P>Well, but in the time we have before us the workman was but
thought of as a convenient machine, and this machine, driven by the
haphazard whims of the time, produced at Meissen, at S&eacute;vres,
at Chelsea, at Derby, and in Staffordshire, a most woeful set of
works of art, of which perhaps those of S&eacute;vres were the most
repulsively hideous, those of Meissen (at their worst) the most
barbarous, and those made in England the stupidest, though it may be
the least ugly.</P>

<P>Now this is very briefly the history of the art of pottery down to
our own times, when styleless anarchy prevails; a state of things not
so hopeless as in the last century, because it shows a certain
uneasiness as to whether we are right or wrong, which may be a sign
of life. Meanwhile, as to matters of art, the craft which turns out
such tons of commercial wares, every piece of which ought to be a
work of art, produces almost literally nothing. On this dismal side
of things I will not dwell, but will ask you to consider with me what
can be done to remedy it; a question which I know exercises much many
excellent and public-spirited men who are at the head of pottery
works.</P>

<P>Well, in the first place, it is clear that the initiative cannot
be wholly taken by these men; we, all of us I mean who care about the
arts, must help them by asking for the right thing, and making them
quite clear what it is we ask for. To my mind it should be something
like this, which is but another way of putting those principles of
the art which I spoke of before:-</P>

<P>1<I>st</I>, No vessel should be fashioned by being pressed into a
mould that can be made by throwing on the wheel, or otherwise by
hand.</P>

<P>2<I>d</I>, All vessels should be finished on the wheel, not turned
in a lathe, as is now the custom. How can you expect to have good
workmen when they know that whatever surface their hands may put on
the work will be taken off by a machine?</P>

<P>3<I>d</I>, It follows, as a corollary to the last point, that we
must not demand excessive neatness in pottery, and this more
especially in cheap wares. Workmanlike finish is necessary, but
finish to be workmanlike must always be in proportion to the kind of
work. What we get in pottery at present is mechanical finish, not
workmanlike, and is as easy to do as the other is hard: one is a
matter of a manager's system, the other comes of constant thought and
trouble on the part of the men, who by that time are artists, as we
call them.</P>

<P>4<I>th</I>, As to the surface decoration on pottery, it is clear
it must never be printed; for the rest, it would take more than an
hour to go even very briefly into the matter of painting on pottery;
but one rule we have for a "rude, and whatever we do if we abide by
it, we are quite sure to go wrong if we reject it: and it is common
to all the lesser arts. Think of your material. Don't paint anything
on pottery save what can be painted only on pottery; if you do, it is
clear that however good a draughtsman you may be, you do not care
about that special art. You can't suppose that the Greek
wall-painting was anything like their painting on pottery- there is
plenty of evidence to show that it was not. Or, take another example
from the Persian art; it is easy for those conversant with it to tell
from an outline tracing of a design whether it was done for
pottery-painting or for other work.</P>

<P>5<I>th</I>, Finally, when you have asked for these qualities from
the potters, and even in a very friendly way Boycotted them a little
till you get them, you will of course be prepared to pay a great deal
more for your pottery than you do now, even for the rough work you
may have to take. I'm sure that won't hurt you; we shall only have
less and break less, and our incomes will still be the same.</P>

<P>Now as to the kindred art of marring glass vessels. It is on much
the same footing as the potter's craft. Never till our own day has an
ugly or stupid glass vessel been made; and no wonder, considering the
capabilities of the art. In the hands of a good workman the metal is
positively alive, and is, you may say, coaxing him to make something
pretty. Nothing but commercial enterprise capturing an unlucky man
and setting him down in the glass-maker's chair with his pattern
beside him (which I should think must generally have been originally
designed by a landscape gardener)-nothing but this kind of thing
could turn out ugly glasses. This stupidity will never be set right
till we give up demanding accurately-gauged glasses made by the
gross. I am fully in earnest when I say that if I were setting about
getting good glasses made, I would get some good workmen together,
tell them the height and capacity of the vessels I wanted, and
perhaps some general idea as to kind of shape, and then let them do
their best. Then I would sort them out as they came from the
annealing arches (what a pleasure that would be!) and I would put a
good price on the best ones, for they would be worth it; and I don't
believe that the worst would be bad.</P>

<P>In speaking of glass-work, it is a matter of course that I am only
thinking of that which is blown and worked by hand; moulded and cut
glass may have commercial, but can't have artistic value.</P>

<P>As to the material of the glass vessels, that is a very important
point. Modern managers have worked very hard to get their glass
colourless: it does not seem to me that they have quite succeeded. I
should say that their glass was cold and bluish in colour; but
whether or not, their aim was wrong. A slight tint is an advantage in
the metal, so are slight specks and streaks, for these things make
the form visible. The modern managers of glassworks have taken
enormous pains to get rid of all colour in their glass; to get it so
that when worked into a vessel it shall not show any slightest speck
or streak; in fact, they have toiled to take all character out of the
metal, and have succeeded; and this in spite of the universal
admiration for the Venice glass of the seventeenth century, which is
both specked and streaky, and has visible colour in it. This glass of
Venice or Murano is most delicate in its form, and was certainly
meant quite as much for ornament as use; so you may be sure that if
the makers of it had seen any necessity for getting more mechanical
perfection in their metal they would have tried for it and got it;
but like all true artists they were contented when they had a
material that served the purpose of their special craft, and would
not weary themselves in seeking after what they did not want. And I
feel sure that if they had been making glass for ordinary table use
at a low price, and which ran more risks of breakage, as they would
have had to fashion their vessels thicker and less daintily they
would have been contented with a rougher metal than that which they
used. Such a manufacture yet remains to be set on foot, and I very
much wish it could be done; only it must be a manufacture; must be
done by hand, and not by machine, human or otherwise.</P>
