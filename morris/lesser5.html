As to the other manufacture of unmechanically woven cloth, the art of
tapestry-weaving, it was, while it flourished, not only an art of
Europe, but even of Northern Europe. Still more than carpet-weaving,
it must be spoken of in the past tense. If you are curious on the
subject of its technique you may see that going on as in its earlier,
or let us say real, life at the Gobelins at Paris; but it is a
melancholy sight: the workmen are as handy at it as only Frenchmen
can be at such work, and their skill is traditional too, I have
heard; for they are the sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons of
tapestry weavers. Well, their ingenuity is put to the greatest pains
for the least results: it would be a mild word to say that what they
make is worthless; it is more than that; it has a corrupting and
deadening influence upon all the Lesser Arts of France, since it is
always put forward as the very standard and crown of all that those
arts can do at the best: a more idiotic waste of human labour and
skill it is impossible to conceive. There is another branch of the
same stupidity, differing slightly in technique, at Beauvais; and the
little town of Aubusson in mid-France has a decaying commercial
industry of the like rubbish I am sorry to have to say that an
attempt to set the art going, which has been made, doubtless with the
best intentions, under royal patronage at Windsor, within the last
few years, has most unluckily gone on the lines of the work at the
Gobelins, and if it does not change its system utterly, is doomed to
artistic failure, whatever its commercial success may be.</P>

<P>Well, this is all I have to say about the poor remains of the art
of tapestry-weaving: and yet what a noble art it was once! To turn
our chamber walls into the green woods of "the leafy month of June,"
populous of bird and beast; or a summer garden with man and maid
playing round the fountains, or a solemn procession of the mythical
warriors and heroes of old; that surely was worth the trouble of
doing, and the money that had to be paid for it: that was no languid
acquiescence in an upholsterer's fashion.</P>

<P>How well I remember as a boy my first acquaintance with a room
hung with faded greenery at Queen Elizabeth's Lodge, - by Chingford
Hatch, in Epping Forest (I wonder what has become of it now?), and
the impression of romance that it made upon me! a feeling that always
comes back on me when I read, as I often do, Sir Walter Scott's
<I>Antiquary</I>, and come to the description of the Green Room at
Monkbarns, amongst which the novelist has with such exquisite cunning
of art imbedded the fresh and glittering verses of the summer poet
Chaucer: yes, that was more than upholstery, believe me.</P>

<P>Nor must you forget that when the art was at its best, while on
the one side it was almost a domestic art, and all sorts of naive
fancies were embodied in it, it took the place in Northern Europe of
the fresco painting of Italy; among the existing easel pictures of
the Flemish school of the fifteenth century there are no designs
which are equal in conception and breadth of treatment to those which
were worked out in tapestry, and I believe that some of the very best
Northern artists spent the greater part of their time in designing
for this art Roger van der Weyden of the Cologue school is named as
having done much in this way: under the gallery of the great hall at
Hampton Court hangs a piece, which I suppose is by him, and which at
any rate is, taking it altogether, the finest piece I have seen.
There is quite a school of tapestry in the place, by the way: the
withdrawing room or solar at the end of the hall is hung with
tapestries, but little inferior to the first mentioned and perhaps a
little later, but unluckily, unlike it, much obscured by the dirt of
centuries (not faded, only dirty), while the main walls of the great
hall itself are hung with work of a later date, say about 1580. You
may test your taste by comparing these later works (very- fine of
their kind) with the earlier, and seeing which you like best. I will
not try to influence you on this matter, but will only say that the
borders of this later tapestry are admirably skilful pieces of
execution.</P>

<P>Perhaps you will think I have said too much about an art that has
practically perished; but as there is nothing whatever to prevent us
from reviving it if we please, since the technique of it is easy to
the last degree, so also it seems to me that in the better days of
art the- exaltation of certain parts of a craft into the region of
the higher arts was both a necessary consequence of the excellence of
the craft as a whole, and in return kept up that excellence to its
due pitch by example; the magnificent woven pictures of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries were the natural result of the pleasure and
skill that were exercised in the art of weaving in every village and
homestead, at the same time that they were an encouragement to the
humbler brother of the craft to persevere in doing his best.</P>

<P>I have now to speak of a craft which I daresay some of you will
think a lesser art indeed, but which nevertheless we cannot help
considering if we are to trouble ourselves at all about the art- of
weaving. This is the dyer's craft: of which I must say that no craft
has been so oppressed by the philistinism of false commerce, or by
the ignorance of the public as to their real wants; which oppression
is of very late date, and belongs almost wholly to our own days.</P>

<P>I should very much like to be able to tell you the whole story of
this ancient craft, but time fails me to give you more than the very
barest outline of it.</P>

<P>The ancient Egyptians knew well the niceties of the art. I myself
have dyed wool red by the self same process that the Mosaical dyers
used; and from the remotest times the whole art was thoroughly
understood in India If today I want for my own use some of the red
dye above alluded to, I must send to Argolis or Acharnania for it;
and Pliny would have been quite at home in the dye-house of
Tintoretto's father (or master); no change at all befell the art
either in the East or the North till after the discovery of America;
this gave the dyers one new material in itself good, and one that was
doubtful or bad. The good one was the new insect dye, cochineal,
which at first was used only for dyeing crimson (or bluish red), and
for this use cast into the shade the older red insect dye above
alluded to, called by the classical peoples coccus, and by the Arabs
Al kermes. The bad new material was logwood, so fugitive a dye as to
be quite worthless as a colour by itself (as it was at first used),
and to my mind of very little use otherwise. No other new dye-stuff
of importance was found in America although the discoverers came
across such abundance of red-dyeing wood growing there that a huge
country of South America has thence taken its name of Brazil.</P>

<P>The next change happened about 163O, when a German discovered
accidentally how to dye scarlet with cochineal on a tin basis,
thereby putting the old dye, kermes, almost wholly out of commerce.
'Next, in the last years of the eighteenth century, a worthless blue
was invented (which I don't name, to avoid confusion in this brief
sketch). About the same time a rather valuable yellow dye (quercitron
bark) was introduced from America. Next, in 1810, chemical science,
which by this time had got fairly on its legs, began to busy itself
about the dyer's craft, and discovered how to dye with Prussian blue,
a colour which, as a pigment, had been discovered about eighty years
before; this discovery was rather harmful than otherwise to my mind,
but was certainly an important one, since before that time there was
but one dyeing drug that could give a blue colour capable of standing
a week of diffused daylight even,--indigo to wit, whether it was
produced from tropical or sub-tropical plants, or from our 'Northern
plant, woad.</P>

<P>Now these novelties, the sum of which amounts to very little, are
all that make any difference between the practice of dyeing under
Rameses the Great and under Queen Victoria, till about twenty years
ago; about that time a series of the most wonderful discoveries were
made by the chemists; discoveries which did the utmost credit to
their skill, patience, and capacity for scientific research, and
which, from a so-called commercial point of view, have been of the
greatest importance; for they have, as the phrase goes,
revolutionised the art of dyeing The dye stuffs discovered by the
indefatigable genius of scientific chemists, which every one has
heard of under the name of aniline colours, and which are the product
of coal-tar, are brighter and stronger in colour than the old dyes,
cheaper (much cheaper) in price, and, which is of course of the last
importance to the dyer, infinitely easier to use. No wonder,
therefore, that they have almost altogether supplanted the older
dyes, except in a few cases: surely the invention seems a splendid
one!</P>

<P>Well, it is only marred by one fact, that being an invention for
the benefit of an art whose very existence depends upon its producing
beauty, it is on the road, and far advanced on it, towards destroying
all beauty in the art. The fact is, that every one of these colours
is hideous in itself, whereas all the old dyes are in themselves
beautiful colours only extreme perversity could make an ugly colour
out of them. Under these circumstances it must, I suppose, be
considered a negative virtue in the new dyes, that they are as
fugitive as the older ones are stable; but even on that head I will
ask you to note one thing that condemns them finally, that whereas
the old dyes when fading, as all colours will do more or less, simply
gradually changed into paler tints of the same colour, and were not
unpleasant to look on, the fading of the new dyes is a change into
all kinds of abominable and livid hues. I mention this because
otherwise it might be thought that a man with an artistic eye for
colour might so blend the hideous but bright aniline colours as to
produce at least something tolerable; indeed, this is not
unfrequently attempted today, but with small success, partly from the
reason above mentioned, partly because the hues so produced by
"messing about" as I should call it, have none of the quality or
character which the simpler drug gives naturally: all artists will
understand what I mean by this.</P>

<P>In short, this is what it comes to, that it would be better for
us, if we cannot revive the now almost lost art of dyeing, to content
ourselves with weaving our cloths of the natural colour of the fibre,
or to buy them coloured by less civilised people than ourselves.</P>

<P>Now, really even if you think the art of dyeing as contemptible as
Pliny did, you must admit that this is a curious state of things, and
worth while considering, even by a philosopher. It is most true that
the chemists of our day have made discoveries almost past belief for
their wonder; they have given us a set of colours which has made a
new thing of the dyer's craft; commercial enterprise has eagerly
seized on the gift, and yet, unless all art is to disappear from our
woven stuffs, we must turn round and utterly and simply reject it. We
must relegate these new dyes to a museum of scientific curiosities,
and for our practice go back, if not to the days of the Pharaohs, yet
at least to those of Tintoret.</P>

<P>I say I invite you to consider this, because it is a type of the
oppression under which the lesser arts are suffering at the present
day.</P>

<P>The art of dyeing leads me naturally to the humble but useful art
of printing on cloth; really a very ancient art, since it is not
essential to it that the pattern should be printed; it may be painted
by hand. Now, the painting of cloth with real dyes was practiced from
the very earliest days in India; and, since the Egyptians of Pliny's
time knew the art well, it is most probable that in that
little-changing land it was very old also. Indeed many of the minute
and elaborate patterns on the dresses of Egyptian imagery impress me
strongly as representing what would naturally be the work of
dye-painted linen.</P>

<P>As to the craft among ourselves, it has, as a matter of course,
suffered grievously from the degradation of dyeing, and this not only
from the worsening of the tints both in beauty and durability, but
from a more intricate cause. I have said that the older dyes were
much more difficult to use than the modern ones. The processes for
getting a many coloured pattern on to a piece of cotton, even so
short a while back as when I was a boy, were many and difficult. As a
rule, this is done in fewer hours now than it was in days then. You
may think this a desirable change, but, except on the score of
cheapness, I can't agree with you. The natural and healthy
difficulties of the old processes, all connected as they were with
the endeavour to make the colour stable, drove any designer who had
anything in him to making his pattern peculiarly suitable to the
whole art, and gave a character to it--that character which you so
easily recognise in Indian palampores, or in the faded curtains of
our grandmothers' time, which still, in spite of many a summer's sun
and many and many a strenuous washing, retain at least their reds and
blues. In spite of the rudeness or the extravagance of these things,
we are always attracted towards them, and the chief reason is, that
we feel at once that there is something about the designs natural to
the craft, that they can be done only by the practice of it; a
quality which, I must once more repeat, is a necessity for all the
designs of the lesser arts. But in the comparatively easy way in
which these cloths are printed to-day, there are no special
difficulties to stimulate the designer to invention; he can get any
design done on his cloth; the printer will make no objections, so
long as the pattern is the right size for his roller, and has only
the due number of colours. The result of all this is ornament on the
cotton, which might just as well have been printed or drawn on paper,
and in spite of any grace or cleverness in the design, it is found to
look poor and tame and wiry. That you will see clearly enough when
some one has had a fancy to imitate some of the generous and fertile
patterns that were once specially designed for the older cloths: it
all comes to nothing--it is dull, hard, unsympathetic.</P>

<P>No; there is nothing for it but the trouble and the simplicity of
the earlier craft, if you are to have any beauty in cloth-printing at
all. And if not, why should we trouble to have a pattern of any sort
on our cotton cloths? I for one am dead against it, unless the
pattern is really beautiful; it is so very worthless if it is
not.</P>

<P>As I have been speaking about printing on cotton cloths, I suppose
I am bound to say something also on the quite modern and very humble,
but, as things go, useful art of printing patterns on paper for wall
hangings. But really there is not much to be said about it, unless we
were considering the arrangement and formation of its patterns;
because it is so very free from those difficulties the meeting and
conquering of which give character to the more intricate crafts. I
think the real way to deal successfully with designing for
paper-hangings is to accept their mechanical nature frankly, to avoid
falling into the trap of try-in" to make your paper look as if it
were painted by hand. Here is the place, if anywhere, for dots and
lines and hatchings: mechanical enrichment is of the first necessity
in it. After that you may be as intricate and elaborate in your
pattern as you please; nay, the more and the more mysteriously you
interweave your sprays and stems the better for your purpose, as the
whole thing has to be pasted flat on a wall, and the cost of all this
intricacy will but come out of your own brain and hand. For the rest,
the fact that in this art we are so little helped by beautiful and
varying material imposes on us the necessity for being specially
thoughtful in our designs; every one of them must have a distinct
idea in it; some beautiful piece of nature must have pressed itself
on our notice so forcibly that we are quite full of it, and can, by
submitting ourselves to the rules of art, express our pleasure to
others, and give them some of the keen delight that we ourselves have
felt, If we cannot do this in some measure our paper design will not
be worth much; it will be but a makeshift expedient for covering a
wall with something or other; and if we really care about art we
shall not put up with "something or other," but shall choose honest
whitewash instead, on which sun and shadow play so pleasantly, if
only our room be well planned and well shaped, and look kindly on
us.</P>

<P>A great if indeed; which lands me at once into my next division of
the lesser arts, which for want of a better word I will call
house-furnishing: I say it lands me there, because if only our houses
were built as they should be, we should want such a little
furniture--and be so happy in that scantiness. Even as it is, we
should at all events take as our maxim the less the better: excess of
furniture destroys the repose of a lazy man, and is in the way of an
industrious one; and besides, if we really care for art we shall
always feel inclined to save on superfluities, that we may have
wherewithal to spend on works of art.
