<HR>

Simplicity is the one thing needful in furnishing, of that I am
certain; I mean first as to quantity, and secondly as to kind and
manner of design; the arrangement of our houses ought surely to
express the kind of life we lead, or desire to lead; and to my mind
if there is anything to be said in favour of that to-day somewhat
well-abused English Middle Class, it is that, amidst all the
narrowness that is more or less justly charged against it, it has a
kind of orderly intelligence which is not without some value; such as
it is, such its houses ought to be if it takes any pains about them,
as I think it should: they should look like part of the life of
decent citizens prepared to give good commonplace reasons for what
they do: for us to set to work to imitate the minor vices of the
Borgias, or the degraded an 1 nightmare whims of the <I>blas&eacute;
</I> and bankrupt French aristocracy of Louis XV.'s time, seems to me
merely ridiculous. So I say our furniture should be good citizen's
furniture, solid and well made in workmanship, and in design should
have nothing about it that is not easily defensible, no monstrosities
or extravagances, not even of beauty, lest we weary of it: as to
matters of construction, it should not have to depend on the special
skill of a very- picked workman, or the superexcellence of his glue,
but be made on the proper principles of the art of joinery: also I
think that, except for very movable things like chairs, it should not
be so very light as to be nearly imponderable; it should be made of
timber rather than walking-sticks. Moreover, I must needs think of
furniture as of two kinds: one part of it being chairs, dining and
working tables, and the like, the necessary work-a-day furniture in
short, which should be of course both well made and well
proportioned, but simple to the last degree; nay, if it were rough I
should like it the better, not the worse; with work-a-day furniture
like this we should among other blessings avoid the terror which now
too often goes with the tolerably regularly recurring accidents of
the week.</P>

<P>But besides this kind of furniture, there is the other kind of
what I should call state-furniture, which I think is proper even for
a citizen; I mean side-boards, cabinets, and the like, which we have
quite as much for beauty's sake as for use; we need not spare
ornament on these, but may make them as elegant and elaborate as we
can with carving, inlaying, or painting; these are the blossoms of
the art of furniture, as picture-tapestry is of the art of weaving:
but these also should not be scattered about the house at haphazard,
but should be used architecturally to dignify important chambers and
important places in them.</P>

<P>And once more; whatever you have in your rooms think first of the
walls; for they are that which makes your house and home; and if you
don't make some sacrifice in their favour, you will find your
chambers have a kind of makeshift, lodging house look about them,
however rich and handsome your movables may be.</P>

<P>The last of the Lesser Arts I have to speak of I come to with some
trepidation; but it is so important to one half of the race of
civilised mankind, the male half, that I will venture: indeed I speak
of the art of dress with the more terror because civilisation has
settled for us males that art shall have no place in our clothes, and
that we must in this matter occupy the unamiable position of critics
of our betters; rebel as I am, I bow to that decision, though I find
it difficult to admit that a chimney pot hat or a tail-coat is the
embodiment of wisdom in clothes-philosophy; and sometimes in my more
sceptical moments I puzzle myself in thinking <I>why</I>, when I am
indoors, I should wear two coats, one with a back and no front, and
the other with a front and no back: however, I have not near enough
courage even to suggest a rebellion against these stern sartorial
laws; and after all one can slip into and out of the queer things
with great ease, and that being the case, it is far more important to
me what other people wear than what I wear: so that I ask leave to be
an irresponsible critic for a few moments.</P>

<P>Now I have lived through at least two periods of feminine dress,
without counting the present one, which I perceive with some terror
is trembling on the verge of change: yes, with terror, because for a
good many years past, in spite of a few extravagancies, the dress of
ladies in England has been highly satisfactory, and very consolatory
for the mishaps that have befallen the lesser arts otherwise.</P>

<P>Under these circumstances, both for the sake of the hope and the
warning that may lie in it, I will venture to call to your memory
what has befallen the art of dress in modern times.</P>

<P>The days of Louis XV. draw across our path a kind of enchanted
wood of abominations into which we need not venture: out of those
horrors costume escaped into a style that was really graceful and
simple in the years that came just before the French Revolution. What
this costume really was you can see as clearly as anywhere in the
engravings designed by the quaint and fertile book illustrator, the
Pole Chodowiescki, whose works were much imitated by our Stothard.
Then came a period when dress was influenced by the affectation of
imitating the art and manners of the classical times, which produced
under the First Napoleon a costume characterised by somewhat of an
exaggeration of slim gracefulness amongst other extravagancies; for
which affectations a dire revenge was lying in wait, the result of
which, after a doubtful time between the dates of the Battle of
Waterloo and the accession of Queen Victoria, was a style which one
may call that of grim modern respectability: into the middle of that
period I was born, and well I remember its horrors. If you can get at
an <I>Illustrated London News</I> of about the time of the Queen's
visit to Louis Philippe, look at the costumes in it; they will give
you cause for serious reflection: or for an earlier example (I think)
take up your <I>Oliver Twist</I>, with George Cruikshank's
illustrations, and contemplate on the effigy there figured of that
insipid person Miss Rose Maylie.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></P>

<P>Well, that was the first period I have seen; on this period
gradually crept another, which, at its height at least, could not be
accused of over-much love of respectability: this period was that of
crinoline. The woodcuts of John Leech give you admirable
illustrations of all the stages of this period. It conquered
something from its predecessor in that on the whole it allowed women
to arrange their hair naturally and gracefully; but in everything
else mere blatant vulgarity was apparently what it aimed at. I have
good hopes that one may say that the degradation of costume reached
its lowest depth in this costume of the Second Empire.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P>

<P>This is the second period of costume that I have seen, and its end
brings us to the beginning of things as they are; when woman's dress
is or may be on the whole graceful and sensible--please note that I
say it <I>may be</I>--for the most hopeful sign of the present period
is its freedom: in the two previous periods there was no freedom; in
that of grim respectability a lady was positively under well
understood penalties not allowed to dress gracefully, she could not
do it; under the reign of crinoline if she had dressed simply and
beautifully,--like a lady, in short, she would have been hooted in
the streets; but now-a-days, and for years past, a lady may dress
quite simply and beautifully and yet not be noticed as having
anything peculiar or theatrical in her costume. Extravagancies of
fashion have not been lacking to us, but no one has been compelled to
adopt them; every one might dress herself in the way which her own
good sense told her suited her best. Now this, ladies, is the first
and greatest necessity of rational and beautiful costume, that you
should keep your liberty of choice; so I beg you to battle stoutly
for it, or we shall all tumble into exploded follies again.</P>

<P>Then next, your only chance of keeping that liberty is, to resist
the imposition on costume of unnatural monstrosities. Garments should
veil the human form, and neither caricature it, nor obliterate its
lines: the body should be draped, and neither sewn up in a sack, nor
stuck in the middle of a box: drapery, properly managed, is not a
dead thing, but a living one, expressive of the endless beauty of
motion; and if this be lost, half the pleasure of the eyes in common
life is lost. You must specially bear this in mind, because the
fashionable milliner has chiefly one end in view, how to hide and
degrade the human body in the most expensive manner. She (or he)
would see no beauty in the Venus of Milo; she (or he) looks upon you
as scaffolds on which to hang a bundle of cheap rags, which can be
sold dear under the name of a dress Now, ladies, if you do not resist
this to the bitter end, costume is ruined again, and all we males are
rendered inexpressibly unhappy. So I beg of you fervently do not
allow yourselves to be upholstered like armchairs, but drape
yourselves like women.</P>

<P>Lastly, and this is really part of the same counsel, resist change
for the sake of change; this is the very bane of all the arts. I say
resist this stupidity, and the care of dress duly subordinated to
other duties, is a serious duty to you; but if you do not resist it,
the care of dress becomes a frivolous waste of time. It follows, from
the admission of this advice, that you should insist on having
materials for your dresses that are excellent of their kind, and
beautiful of their kind, and that when you have a dress of even
moderately costly materials, you won't be in a hurry to see the end
of it. This is a thing too which will help us weavers, body and soul,
and in a due and natural way: not like the too good natured way of my
Lady Bective, who wants you to wear stiff alpaca, so that the
Bradford capitalists may not have to change their machinery. I can't
agree to that; if they <I>will</I> weave ugly cloth, let them take
the consequences.</P>

<P>But one good thing breeds another, and most assuredly a steadiness
in fashion, when a good fashion has been attained to, and a love of
beautiful things for their own sakes and not because they are
novelties, is both human, reasonable, and civilised, and will help
the maker of wares, both master and man, and give them also time to
think of beautiful things, and thus to raise their lives to a higher
level.</P>

<P>Thus I have named a certain number of the lesser arts, which I
must ask you to take as representing the whole mass of them: now all
these arts, since they at all events make a show of life, one may
suppose civilisation considers desirable, if not necessary; but if
they are to go on existing and to occupy in one way or other the
lives of millions of men, it seems to me that their life should be
real, that the necessity for them should be felt by those that allow
them to be carried on; for surely wasted -labour is a heavy burden
for the world to bear.</P>

<P>I have said that, on the other hand, I am ready to accept the
conclusion that these arts are vain and should not be carried on at
all; that we should do nothing that we can help doing beyond what is
barely necessary to keep ourselves alive, that we may contemplate the
mystery of life, and be ready to accept the mystery of death. Yes,
that might be agreed to, if the world would; but, you see, it will
not. man's life is too complex, too unmanageable at the hands of any
unit of the race for such a conclusion to be come to, except by a
very few, better--or it may be worse--than their fellows; and even
they will be driven to it by noting the contrast between their
aspirations and the busy and inconsistent lives of other men. I mean,
if most men lived reasonably, and with justice to their fellows, no
men would be drawn towards asceticism.</P>

<P>No, the lesser arts of life must be practiced, that is clear. It
only remains therefore for us to determine whether they shall but
minister to our material needs, receiving no stimulus and no help
from the cravings of our souls, or whether they shall really form
part of our lives material and spiritual, and be so helpful and
natural, that even the sternest philosopher may look upon them kindly
and feel helped by them.</P>

<P>Is it possible that civilisation can determine to brutalise the
crafts of life by cutting them off from the intellectual part of us?
Surely not in the long run; and yet I know that the progress of the
race from barbarism to civilisation has hitherto had a tendency to
make our lives more and more complex; to make us more dependent one
upon the other, and to destroy individuality, which is the breath of
life to art; but swiftly and without check as this -tendency has
grown, I know I cannot be alone in doubting if it has been an unmixed
good to us, or in believing that a change will come, perhaps after
some great disaster has chilled us into pausing, and so given us time
for reflection: anyhow, in some way or other, I believe the day is
not so far distant when the best of men will set to work trying to
simplify life on a new basis--when the organisation of labour will
mean something else than the struggle of the strong to use each one
to his best advantage the necessities and miseries of the weak.</P>

<P>Meanwhile I believe that it will speed the coming of that day if
we do but look open-eyed at art and with all sincerity-; I want an
end of believing that we believe in art-bogies; I want the democracy
of the arts established: I want every one to think for himself about
them, and not to take things for granted from hearsay; every man to
do what he thinks right, not in anarchical fashion, but feeling that
he is responsible to his fellows for what he feels, thinks, and has
determined.</P>

<P>In these lesser arts every one should say: I have such or such an
ornamental matter, not because I am told to like it, but because I
like it myself, and I will have nothing that I don't like--nothing;
and I can give you my reasons for rejecting this, and accepting that,
and am ready to abide by them, and to take the consequences of my
being right or wrong. Of course such independence must spring from
knowledge, not from ignorance, and you may be sure that this kind of
independence would be far from destroying the respect due to the
higher intellects that busy themselves with the arts; on the
contrary, it would make that respect the stronger, since those who
had themselves got to think seriously about the arts would understand
the better what difficulties beset the greatest men in their
struggles to express what is in them. Anyhow, if this intelligent,
sympathetic, and serious independence of thought about the arts does
not become general among cultivated men (and all men ought to be
cultivated) it is a matter of course that the practice of the arts
must fall into the hands of a degraded and despised class, degraded
and despised at least as far as its daily work goes; that is to say,
the greater part of its waking hours.</P>

<P>Surely this is a serious danger to our political and social
advancement, to our cultivation, to our civilisation, in short;
surely we can none of us be content to accept the responsibility of
creating such a- class - of pariahs, or to sit quiet under the burden
of its existence, if it exist at present, as indeed it does.</P>

<P>Therefore I ask you to apply the remedy of refusing to be ignorant
and nose-led about the arts; I ask you to learn what you want and to
ask for it; in which case you will both get it and will breed
intelligent and worthy citizens for the common weal; defenders of
society, friends for yourselves.</P>

<P>Is not this worth doing? It will add to the troubles of life.
Maybe; I will not say nay. Yet consider after all that the life of a
man is more troublous than that of a swine, and the life of a freeman
than the life of a slave; and take your choice accordingly.</P>

<P>Moreover, if I am right in these matters, your trouble will be
shifted, not increased: we shall take pains indeed concerning things
which we care about, hard and bitter pains maybe, yet with an end in
view; but the confused, aimless, and for ever unrewarded pains which
we now so plentifully take about things we do not care about, we
shall sweep all that away, and so shall win calmer rest and more
strenuous, less entangled work.</P>

<P>What other blessings are there in life save these two,-fearless
rest and hopeful work? Troublous as life is, it has surely given to
each one of us here some times and seasons when, surrounded by simple
and beautiful things, we have really felt at rest; when the earth and
all its plenteous growth, and the tokens of the varied life of men,
and the very sky and waste of air above us, have seemed all to
conspire together to make us calm and happy, not slothful but restful
Still oftener belike it has given us those other times when at last
after many a struggle with incongruous hindrances our own chosen work
has lain before us disentangled from all encumbrances and
unrealities, and we have felt that nothing could withhold us, not
even ourselves, from doing the work we were born to do, and that we
were men and worthy of life.</P>

<P>Such rest, and such work, I earnestly wish for myself and for you,
and for all men: to have space and freedom to gain such rest and such
work, is the end of politics; to learn how best to gain it is the end
of education; to learn its inmost meaning is the end of religion.</P>

ladies are determined to try whether ugliness may not be more
attractive than beauty.
