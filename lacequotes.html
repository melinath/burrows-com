<BLOCKQUOTE>Many clients of J.R. Burrows &amp; Co. ask about the
   correct original method of hanging Victorian lace curtains. As
   with much Victorian decorating, there is no simple correct answer,
   but this book chapter from the 1890's suggests some of the common
   treatments. At the time, most lace panels were sold in only one or
   two lengths (typically 126" and 144") which were much longer than
   needed, so the homeowner needed to decide what to do with the
   excess. It is a modern convenience that lace panels are stocked in
   a variety of shorter lengths. A careful investigation of the
   woodwork in your home might provide clues on the original method
   employed to hang the curtains.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>LACE</B> curtains that are to hang under long curtains or
lambrequins should be arranged so they can be easily removed without
taking down the other work. The practice of attaching them to the
same rings that support the other drapery when poles are used is a
bad one, as it brings them all too close together to allow either to
drape well. The best method is to turn a hem at the top to receive a
rod which is supported by hooks or brackets on the casing. See that
in hanging they do not show over the other work. The laces will shirr
nicely on the rod, and always hang well. They can thus be quickly
taken down, and there are no hooks or rings to rip off when
laundered. Use a brass or hard-wood rod, as iron will be apt to
rust.</P>

<P>The curtains are usually much longer than is required for the
greater number of windows, and for those people who object to having
them cut off, some way is to be provided to dispose of the surplus
length. When used under lambrequins, they can be folded over toward
the front, so not to show from the street side, and can thus be
hidden by the curtain or lambrequin. When they are used without other
drapery and are pleated and hung directly from the poles, it is a
different matter. Not over twelve inches can be folded away at the
top without looking badly. Another foot can be left for the bottom,
which can be kept off the floor by draping from the bottom. This will
allow almost the full width to display the borders to good advantage.
Grasp the lower edge near the back, and gather in the pleats until
high enough to reach the loops. After putting the loop around, pick
out and arrange the pleats.</P>

<P>Another way is to bring the lower back corner up to the side hook,
gathering in the pleats fan-shape, and allowing the bottom border to
hang vertically, the front corner just lying a few inches on the
floor. Try it. Sew a loop of tape to the back of the lace to attach
to the hook. Either method is of doubtful economy unless there is a
prospect of their being required else-where. The best method is to
cut them to reach the floor, and then they can be allowed to hang
straight and yet be of proper length to loop back. The tops could be
used as sash curtains if one so desired.</P>

<P>A very pretty way of treating the cream and colored madras
curtains is to cut them off the proper length and use the top as a
valance, fringing the bottom and shirring the top in with the head of
the curtains. They should be cut off, as simply turning them over
would show the wrong side of the goods. They could also be made with
a hem at the top, run on a rod, while the tops were made up
separately into a shirred or pleated valance to be hung to the pole
over the curtain. The latter is preferable and could of course be
carried out with any description of curtain. When necessary to clean
the laces, it is best to send them to those who make a specialty of
such business, but, if not convenient to do so, the following method,
from "The Decorator and Furnisher," will be found very efficient.</P>

<P>"Soak them over-night in warm water with soap and a couple of
spoonfuls of borax or ammonia. After soaking twelve hours, move them
around in the tub and that will be sufficient to remove everything
but stains. Rinse them thoroughly in clean, warm water. Stretch them
a little and fasten them to frames to keep them from shrinking."
Frames can be made of light strips of board screwed together at the
corners so they can be easily taken apart and packed away for future
use; or the curtains can be tacked out on the floor, previously
covering the carpet with large sheets of paper. Be sure, when tacking
out, that the front edge and bottom are at right angles. Keep the
back edge as near parallel to the front as the work will permit. All
the unevenness will then be at the top, and the curtains will dry out
nice and square. The top will have to be trimmed off square and
rehemmed for the rod. Use very little starch, as, the more flexible
they are, the more graceful they will hang.</P>

<P>A common method of mending laces is to starch on the patches; some
sewing will be needed, however, for large places. At the low price of
laces, few people would care to spend much time and patience in
extensive patching. The color of ecru can be restored by an infusion
of coffee in the water. Try the tone of the dye before putting in the
curtains. Laces are now sold so low that some kinds are within the
means of almost everybody, and nothing freshens up the room so, or
suggests to an outsider the refinement within, so much as a bit of
lace in the window.</P>

<P>If using madras in place of lace for under curtains, it is best to
select plain grounds in light cream, ecru, or pale gold, and avoid
those containing strong colored figures, however handsome they might
be in themselves, as it is better to have the curtains next to the
glass coolest in tone.</P>

<P><B>GLASS CURTAINS</B> are short curtains to go inside the casing,
and are usually hung on a small rod with sockets or eyes on the stop
beads, unless the window shades should be on the outside of casing.
They will then have the rods supported by brackets projecting far
enough to keep the curtain clear of the shade. Lace curtains of this
kind are often used at the same window with long laces, and it is
also a very tasteful way to drape chamber and cottage windows, and
show the casing all round. Make them of some light material, silk,
muslin, or madras, and trim them with soft fringes.</P>

<P>A dainty way of trimming glass curtains is to use a lace two or
two and a half inches wide, or they can be had in regular pattern
curtains, in pairs, in Cluny, Brussels, Swiss, Irish point,
Nottingham, etc. Finish these in length to just reach the sill, or,
as many prefer, a few inches below it. Tie back with ribbon or small
silk loops.</P>

<P>The tops can be finished by turning a hem two and a quarter inches
wide. Run another row of stitching through the middle of this hem.
Run the rod through the lower division, and the upper section of hem
will form a ruffled heading. If necessary to move them back and
forward often, it will be better to shirr up the tops in place of
hemming, and put small rings on the back. Making them this way, allow
only one and a quarter inches to turn over for shirring. Gather them
up so they will be an inch or two wider than the length of the rod. A
narrow band of same material or a tape sewed on one inch below top of
heading and small rings every two and a fourth inches.</P>

<P>A tasteful way of hanging short curtains for chamber or cottage
windows is to place the rod with the brackets on the inside member of
casing, so the ornamented ends will show on the face of casing. Shirr
them at top and put rings close together and have them to open and
close with the traverse cord and pulleys in the same manner as
portieres. The pulleys are made with rings to slip over the rod, and
can be had of any house doing an upholstery business. The cord must
match the color of the curtains, and the tassels of lead covered and
netted over with cord of color to harmonize with the curtains. Brass
tassels are apt to break the glass by careless handling. These are to
hang straight up and down or looped back.</P>

<P>Curtains made of thin silk in this manner had better have the
bottoms weighted with a little shot. Make a case of the same material
three-fourths of an inch wide and as long as the width of curtain.
This is divided into compartments, as the shot is filled in a few in
each. Slip the case into the bottom hem, and sew up, and it will keep
the curtain from flying around when the window is open.</P>

<P>Some people prefer to have their glass curtains hung inside the
shade, directly against the glass. It looks very pretty from the
street, but of course would not show on the room side unless the
shade were raised. If the window shade were in its proper place in
the run of the window or that part where the sash cords are, the
laces could be hung on rods placed between the shade and the glass,
placing the sockets on the small bead separating the two sashes, or
if the groove is so narrow as to bring the shade and lace too near
together, the shade should be moved out, else they would be entangled
with the curtain. If they, the shades, could not be placed on the
outside of casing without interfering with the other drapery, notch
out the top of the stop beads and move the shade brackets out into
the space so made. All this can be quickly done by removing the bead.
Leave on the front edge of bead to hide the bracket. This is better
than placing the bracket on the bead, as it allows a wider shade. In
using ribbons for tying back, allow four and a half yards to a
pair.</P>

<P><B>SASH CURTAINS</B> are usually made to cover three-fourths or
the whole of the lower sash. Double-hem the top as explained and run
on a rod with sockets, between the stop beads or outside with
brackets, according to circumstances. The top hem will require two
and a quarter inches, and allow one inch for the lower hem. Make them
of silk, muslin, or madras, and allow about double fullness. Make in
pairs for convenience in opening.</P>

<P><B>VESTIBULE CURTAINS</B> are usually hung with rod top and
bottom, and allow double fullness if possible. Finish them about five
inches longer than the glass opening, so the hemming will not be seen
on the outside. In hanging, place the upper rod first, slip the lower
rod through the hem, and draw down tightly enough to cause the
curtain to hang in well-defined pleats, screwing on the brackets to
hold. For a door with single large opening, a pretty treatment is to
have the curtains in pairs, fringed and weighted with shot. Shirr up
the top, put on rings for the rod. A traverse cord and pulleys with
dainty tassels to match are a nice addition, but as such curtains
would be within easy reach one could dispense with the traverse.</P>
